13:40:33.910986 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;You cannot get an experience like this from other games. It spoiled me, and WoW and other stuff couldn't grab me.&quot;</span>
13:40:41.920292 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;For Achaea to last this long...you know this game is a unique experience.&quot;</span>
13:40:42.240437 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;So, congratulations on making e-crack.&quot;</span>
13:40:43.248648 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;I believe the homepage used to say &quot;Welcome to Achaea, dreams of divine lands, you may never leave&quot;.&quot;</span>
13:40:44.187971 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Entaro in a low, rough voice, &quot;You're my favorite abandoner though.&quot;</span>
13:40:47.292638 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says in a calm voice, &quot;Not even the Sarapis can afford clothing in this economy.&quot;</span>
13:40:48.672630 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Arcturus says, &quot;We should have one of these tea times in New Las Vegas as a field trip.&quot;</span>
13:40:51.442101 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I have a long history of working for IRE and a lot of my content are now staples of the game that you'll all be familiar with, including forays, Yggdrasil, elemental quests, the dragon quest, Underworld, and lots more.&quot;</span>
13:40:57.802803 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Saibel says to Icraa something unintelligible.</span>
13:41:09.971912 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;As someone far newer to even knowing games like this exist, it has definitely gripped me too so we're clearly still winning!&quot;</span>
13:41:17.789395 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sheena says to Ictinus in a chipper, lilting voice, &quot;Thank you for the Ausafoss.&quot;</span>
13:41:21.670326 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aodfionn says in a low, rumbling voice, &quot;They always sucker you back in.&quot;</span>
13:41:23.158497 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Roenalia says in a calm, soothing voice, &quot;I know that feeling.&quot;</span>
13:41:24.241486 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Pharaus says in a commanding, deep voice, &quot;We appreciate you getting rid of the greater elementals ability to scald.&quot;</span>
13:41:47.977216 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;Yeah thank you for the norse stuff in here, i geek out every time i read the stuff climb the tree.&quot;</span>
13:41:57.011778 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Makarios you'll all know as the combat lead and co-producer for the last few years. If you have questions for him, you can send me your intent to join the queue too and I'll pass them on.&quot;</span>
13:42:15.436438 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Last, I'm probably going to be saying 'I have a plan for that' a lot in response to some of your questions. Fair warning.&quot;</span>
13:42:28.036031 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;That sounds less like a warning than very promising.&quot;</span>
13:42:30.471686 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;This is so ridiculously exciting. I think this is the first one of these I've been attending as a fan rather than with gripes.&quot;</span>
13:42:33.448826 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow laughingly says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;That's better than any 'no'.&quot;</span>
13:42:33.571136 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;We're prepared.&quot;</span>
13:42:34.357228 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Ictinus in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;We have a plan for that.&quot;</span>
13:42:39.675587 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Nezaya in a low, rough voice, &quot;From what I know of Icti it's probably both.&quot;</span>
13:42:40.522106 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;The speed of changes over the first few days has been impressive.&quot;</span>
13:42:41.636260 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahlkhan says with an Ashtani accent, &quot;Been real everyone. Peace.&quot;</span>
13:42:54.136492 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahlkhan says with an Ashtani accent, &quot;One for the road.&quot;</span>
13:42:58.130515 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;I have stomach gripes.&quot;</span>
13:42:59.386454 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Ok! Let's get going. Antoninus you're up first!&quot;</span>
13:43:00.850079 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Roenalia says in a calm, soothing voice, &quot;It's the first one I've been too period!&quot;</span>
13:43:05.172575 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;I dunno how many of you are of the younger generation who recently got into MUDs, but I hope you're enjoying your time here.&quot;</span>
13:43:07.450202 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;Alright.&quot;</span>
13:43:12.313961 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Ok i may of missed it.&quot;</span>
13:43:18.588986 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;How do you put questions in the queue.&quot;</span>
13:43:20.313072 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;You can send me a tell to join the queue.&quot;</span>
13:43:26.746656 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says to Proficy with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;Send a tell to Ictinus.&quot;</span>
13:43:29.867064 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;Whoops.&quot;</span>
13:43:33.335084 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;Oh I was invisible to the room, hello.&quot;</span>
13:43:36.815175 # <span style="color:aqua;">&quot;Welcome, welcome,&quot; Antoninus says graciously.</span>
13:43:37.553780 # <span style="color:aqua;">Aroan raises his hand in greeting to Makarios and says &quot;Hi!&quot;</span>

13:43:44.556398 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Somehow that doesn't surprise me Mak.&quot;</span>
13:43:45.489989 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Woah Makarios is also real!&quot;</span>
13:43:50.434649 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Makarios in a guttural voice, &quot;We all knew you were here..... nothing new.&quot;</span>
13:44:04.372602 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Love the crown.&quot;</span>
13:44:05.425293 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Toni has been upstaged.&quot;</span>
13:44:07.378247 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Also, please write your questions in advance if possible.&quot;</span>
13:44:30.120271 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;I have a few questions, and I'm going to safely hide under the excuse that some of these I've been asked to say. You know me, I don't pull questions to be soft. First one: what changes do you intend to make to the Celani program to improve Celani retention and stop the excessively high turnover rate? We all wish there were more who made it.&quot;</span>
13:45:07.029872 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;If I might suggest to tell the person who is up , and also warn the next person in the queue to prepare?&quot;</span>
13:47:38.405548 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;So the Celani program has undergone a lot of change over the years since I joined. It's a lot more streamlined and less restrictive now than it was. And overall the actual conversion rate from Celani -&gt; God is higher than you might expect. That said, interest in the program has somewhat dwindled over the years and I'm not sure if that's related to the general downswing in activity. It very might well be. But that said, I think the vibe of the game and the energy of the team has a big part to play in how Celani adapt to the Garden and I can only see that improving.&quot;</span>
13:48:24.692796 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Those Celani who do go on to play Gods sometimes find that it's hard to fit into the role in the way they'd expected. The absence of a feedback system I think has played a big part in that, which leads me to my first announcement...&quot;</span>
13:48:48.697289 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;As of 5 seconds ago, we now have ESTEEM.&quot;</span>
13:48:55.051762 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Kog says, &quot;The correct reply.&quot;</span>
13:48:56.435947 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Aww.&quot;</span>
13:48:57.690292 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;That's cute.&quot;</span>
13:48:58.386309 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Hahaha.&quot;</span>
13:49:04.264393 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Claes says in a steady, measured voice, &quot;ESTEEM SYSTEM?!&quot;</span>
13:49:07.587806 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;That worked really well in MKO!&quot;</span>
13:49:13.112661 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;Yes!&quot;</span>
13:49:14.636137 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Llialesam says in a deep, rumbling voice, &quot;Oh that's interesting.&quot;</span>
13:49:15.158194 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;That is great.&quot;</span>
13:49:21.883542 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia looks surprised and says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Esteem.&quot;</span>
13:49:22.288618 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Esteem is really cool.&quot;</span>
13:49:32.208509 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aodfionn says in a low, rumbling voice, &quot;Oh, kickass!&quot;</span>
13:49:40.236428 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Oh I love that. HELP ESTEEM.&quot;</span>
13:49:43.214701 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;We are excited.&quot;</span>
13:49:43.517217 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Saibel says something unintelligible.</span>
13:49:51.705547 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Llialesam says in a deep, rumbling voice, &quot;Negative esteem for theosis.&quot;</span>
13:49:55.698678 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Yilui says, &quot;Ohh, makes sense.&quot;</span>
13:50:00.409619 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says to Elmer in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;9/10 that was a good joke.&quot;</span>
13:50:06.908127 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Theosis, &quot;They are just giving feedback on the feedback system, Grandma.&quot;</span>
13:50:08.199867 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Elmer smiles and says, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</span>
13:50:08.859753 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I know that doesn't fully answer the question but I do think that there's no real rule or system or policy that solves an ephemeral problem like God retention. The best we can do there is make feedback easier to get and give, and to be more encouraging and energetic as a team so that the environment is a positive one.&quot;</span>
13:50:10.210761 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Darona says in a lilting voice, &quot;Oh, I have a bunch of these I should write.&quot;</span>
13:50:11.083564 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;I just tried to esteem someone, but cannot?&quot;</span>
13:50:14.292737 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Which we fully intend to do.&quot;</span>
13:50:16.506610 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Is that an error on the scroll? {ESTEEM|boldwhite}.&quot;</span>
13:50:29.798662 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Atalkez says in a silky, smooth tenor voice, &quot;Typo yes.&quot;</span>
13:50:33.530029 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Arcturus says to Blackwillow, &quot;Rhivona messed up again.&quot;</span>
13:50:40.572964 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Typical.&quot;</span>
13:50:57.261348 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Rhivona would never make mistakes this must be sabotage.&quot;</span>
13:51:01.440663 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Ok. Aroan is up next.&quot;</span>
13:51:02.850239 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Hmm, basically we can OOC'&quot;</span>
13:51:09.330431 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Hmm, basically we can OOC'ly upvote people who have been a good influence in the game?&quot;</span>
13:51:21.790792 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Atalkez says to Synbios in a silky, smooth tenor voice, &quot;Yep, or a God, etc.&quot;</span>
13:51:28.322712 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Neat!&quot;</span>
13:51:34.595126 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;You are already accepting others their esteem.&quot;</span>
13:51:47.111445 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;I'll stop talking.&quot;</span>
13:53:33.988606 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;The barrier to entry is definitely a bit of a constant battle. We definitely are open to things there - renown obviously helps and I think the standardisation of limb health as well as the whole hitting your rough maximum base vitals at an earlier level helped, but I think you've probably identified a bigger problem which is that perception really makes that tricky.&quot;</span>
13:54:31.061094 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;We do have a lot of content now and if we're being realistic that amount will grow not go down. I don't think we have a solution to that, but we'll talk about what more we can do there to make it easier to get in on the ground level so to speak.&quot;</span>
13:54:54.029979 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;It's one of the things on the list.&quot;</span>
13:55:08.444573 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Argwin!&quot;</span>
13:55:19.014068 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin says, &quot;Will official bardic and artisanal contests return, or at least more formal support for the player led contests?&quot;</span>
13:55:50.803037 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Mionan says in a high, vibrating voice, &quot;From a new player's standpoint, it is pretty overwhelming with all the systems that we have to begin to understand in order to participate in PvP.&quot;</span>
13:56:38.154818 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'm not against the idea entirely but interest in them has declined quite a bit in recent years. I think ideally I'd like to support more of the player run contests.&quot;</span>
13:56:57.767120 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;If for no other reason than they tend to be more rp-adjacent instead of pseudo ooc submissions like the formal competitions.&quot;</span>
13:57:35.963090 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The best case would be during major events or birthday milestones, we might do a one off themed competition when it makes most sense.&quot;</span>
13:57:51.903832 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zadkiel says in a soft spoken voice, &quot;The results from the last bardic and artisanal contest were never announced and that was years ago now. We were told the submissions were &quot;lost&quot;.&quot;</span>
13:57:56.999340 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;600 soon.&quot;</span>
13:57:58.420107 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Darona says in a lilting voice, &quot;Oop. I gotta run, sorry folks! Love this though! I'll read the log on discord!&quot;</span>
13:58:12.133760 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis says in a lilting voice, &quot;One problem with player run contests is that players tend to vote along organizational/factional lines if they are the judges.&quot;</span>
13:58:17.332556 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;Maybe a contest themed on a world event that's just happened?&quot;</span>
13:58:31.464728 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Agramon says in a calm, slow voice, &quot;Maybe some kind of mechanical support for player run contests?&quot;</span>
13:58:33.132939 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;I.e., right after they've concluded.&quot;</span>
13:58:36.302204 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Yen says, &quot;We've had denizens sponsor design contests now and then.&quot;</span>
13:58:52.227161 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Yeah, that's what I mean by more support.&quot;</span>
13:58:53.417803 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;I do miss bardics.&quot;</span>
13:58:58.075061 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Maybe anonymity, denizen involvement, and so on.&quot;</span>
13:58:58.831731 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Same.&quot;</span>
13:59:03.983571 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Numira says, &quot;Oh, a framework for contests would actually be convenient for orgs to do IC stuff too.&quot;</span>
13:59:05.877397 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Got a few ideas there.&quot;</span>
13:59:12.926914 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;OK! Agramon next.&quot;</span>
13:59:13.485480 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says to Theosis with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;The last one we did when we voted, we didn't know who the entrants were, so that's a positive!&quot;</span>
13:59:14.562374 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Ictinus in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Player initiated, admin supported. We love it.&quot;</span>
13:59:18.177525 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Agramon says in a calm, slow voice, &quot;I'd like to ask about the removal of the old Bard class, and specifically why it had to be done with no warning whatsoever. I understand sometimes sweeping changes need to be made, but in a case like this especially it feels disrespectful to the playerbase to do it out of the blue. I personally spent, and I'm not exaggerating here, hundreds of hours working on my bard offense. This was time I was actively investing in this game, while behind the scenes apparently a decision to replace it had already been made - since I'm sure new bard wasn't developed overnight. It was such a gut punch to wake up one day and find all my hard work gone. So my question is, would you please consider *at least* giving people a heads up before completely deleting a class in the future? Or better yet, can we just have old Bard back as a spec? Thanks!&quot;</span>
13:59:18.351792 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;The cooking competition a few years ago was fun.&quot;</span>

14:00:09.824577 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin says to Synbios, &quot;So far the player led contests have been unable to affect bardic ranks. So far.&quot;</span>
14:00:17.743424 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Will we be seeing new gods, or inactive gods coming back/being recast?&quot;</span>
14:00:19.469848 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Tells exist.&quot;</span>
14:00:24.925491 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;For these sidebar conversations.&quot;</span>

14:00:59.797079 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;I got confused T^T.&quot;</span>
14:02:39.654937 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;We've actually been talking about that the last couple of days (not bard specifically, but announcing things more in advance). Bard has been on the chopping block for quite some time, mostly because to be honest it was implemented in such a disaster of a way that it was basically unmaintainable and there were so many patches to problematic mechanics that it had introduced that it was very much collapsing under the weight of itself. That said, we definitely could've handled that better, as a general rule I don't like fundamentally changing how something plays for the general reason you outlined in your question.&quot;</span>
14:02:53.240753 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;So yes, we mismanaged that one. Lessons were learned.&quot;</span>
14:03:03.201380 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Agramon says in a calm, slow voice, &quot;Thank you, I'm really glad to hear that.&quot;</span>
14:03:33.172038 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I just want to tack onto that briefly as well. When it makes sense, we definitely want to give more advance warning of what we're working on and what's in the pipeline. Bard kind of came out of nowhere for everyone.&quot;</span>
14:03:51.675142 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But I think at least knowing things are on the radar somewhere helps keep things from blindsiding.&quot;</span>
14:04:12.493895 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Agramon says in a calm, slow voice, &quot;It would have made such a big difference for me personally.&quot;</span>
14:04:42.427906 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Archaosa is up next - I saw the question already so I'll go ahead and answer. RE: Gods, we currently have Haskor's ascension event in progress currently, so there's at least one new God potentially up and coming, assuming he passes!&quot;</span>
14:04:56.357613 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</span>

14:05:17.334084 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa sticks out her tongue and says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;I know who I'm gunning for.&quot;</span>
14:05:27.590212 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Inactive gods coming back is heavily dependent on Celani and others being energetic and interested in playing them. We don't force anyone into a role they aren't passionate about. But you can probably expect to see at least one more new God in the future.&quot;</span>
14:05:47.593374 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;By new I mean, active-again, that is.&quot;</span>
14:05:55.813670 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Smashy says with a thick and Trollish accent, &quot;Awesome.&quot;</span>

14:07:40.420167 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I want to completely redo how honors works at some point, but yes that is on the list. I'm not sure what the specific problem is with bloodlines, but the problem with honors not having anything beyond male X or female Y is on the radar. If you have specific concerns there, I'm open to an email on the subject.&quot;</span>
14:08:11.602764 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Raem says in a flowery voice, &quot;If I'm guessing correctly, I think we might be hoping for same-sex adoption of kids. At least I'd like that feature w/ bloodlines.&quot;</span>
14:08:16.638106 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;Right, that.&quot;</span>
14:08:26.372380 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Bloodline isn't adoption, so maybe an adoption system instead.&quot;</span>

14:08:39.422323 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Adoption would be nice.&quot;</span>
14:08:40.780651 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;How about a gender-neutral appellation, like Partner 1 and Partner 2?&quot;</span>
14:08:47.340247 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;I said this on Discord but for the record here: I personally wish we'd give up on the insistence that it doesn't serve as adoption. For better or worse that's just not how people treat it and the resulting confusion isn't productive.&quot;</span>
14:08:58.606460 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis says in a lilting voice, &quot;Charge us to wipe out our bloodlines, Imyrr would want it mentioned.&quot;</span>

14:09:12.055566 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sheena says in a chipper, lilting voice, &quot;And bloodfae.&quot;</span>
14:09:18.958093 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;I would pay to unbloodline Imyrr.&quot;</span>
14:09:20.284211 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Treyal in a low, rough voice, &quot;Here in antiblood spirit.&quot;</span>
14:09:24.965901 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Added both of these to the list to see what we can do. Bloodlining is a famously terrible system, but nothing is off the table here if we can maek it work.&quot;</span>
14:09:30.725874 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis says in a lilting voice, &quot;Thank you!&quot;</span>
14:09:31.883106 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zephyl says with a Baarian accent, &quot;I'd argue that, in a roleplay standpoint, I shouldn't be able to automatically know someone's family tree with a single syntax.&quot;</span>
14:09:33.911296 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;Thank you!&quot;</span>
14:09:34.379745 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says to Zenui, &quot;Could rename the system, I kind of like the family thing on imperian?&quot;</span>
14:09:42.958595 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;That's amazing. Thank you!&quot;</span>
14:09:45.743015 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alashi says in a pensive voice, &quot;Having at least an option to have honours not display mechanical sex would be awesome, for the record. So glad to hear that's being looked at.&quot;</span>
14:09:48.007090 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Yen you're up.&quot;</span>
14:09:51.527134 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Zephyl in a low, rough voice, &quot;I know your name at a glance to be fair.&quot;</span>
14:09:54.624283 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Yen says, &quot;Post-level 100 progression is a lot less developed here than some IRE games, maybe because originally it was never intended to get much farther than that. But times have changed a lot since then. Do you have plans for more development there, like Aetolias L200 system (maybe 180 here, given the massive xp ramp-up at that point) or Lusternias perk system?&quot;</span>
14:10:07.015564 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zephyl smiles impishly and says to Ante with a Baarian accent, &quot;I don't even know my family tree.&quot;</span>
14:10:27.140781 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;We need to address auto bashing first *cough*.&quot;</span>
14:10:48.578930 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;And auto prospecting *cough*.&quot;</span>
14:10:55.209775 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Plans for more development yes. It's one of the first things Mak and I talked about actually. End game pve progression is pretty lacking both in rewards and mechanics and things to do. So the short answer is yes.&quot;</span>
14:10:58.717332 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi smiles impishly and says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;So much coughing this evening.&quot;</span>
14:11:13.946451 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Faerum says, &quot;Nice.&quot;</span>
14:11:22.454176 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I will say that we are almost certainly not going to imitate the level 200 system from Aetolia.&quot;</span>
14:11:27.287078 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios laughingly says, &quot;Still hungry for dragon talismans. Those are my current endgame.&quot;</span>
14:11:39.703817 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin sticks out his tongue and says to Ilsefi, &quot;And crosstalk from people who complained about crosstalk.&quot;</span>
14:11:43.938892 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But I think there's a ton of room for improvement in this area so stay tuned.&quot;</span>
14:12:31.065518 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Alashi is up next!&quot;</span>
14:12:35.923896 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alashi says in a pensive voice, &quot;I think a lot of us were happy with the recent changes to how orgreqs work, like the ability to prioritise. One of the things that's been most frustrating for me is when reqs just seem to disappear into a void. Are there any further plans to improve the orgreq/patron system, with the understanding that it's limited by the availability of people to handle requests?&quot;</span>
14:14:26.166943 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Having priority marking has helped there somewhat, but one of the roadblocks has always been that without an active patron, the organisation doesn't get the same high priority attention due to lack of resources on hand. I have some restructuring thoughts in place to alleviate that as best we can in areas that we can. For example, I think handling most non-rp requests can be done by anyone.&quot;</span>
14:15:38.597245 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;These account for the vast majority of the queue, which should immediately speed things up once we get it organised. The longer form, macro requests that involve events and Gods and big RP beats will likely remain a hard problem to solve, but it kind of ties back into what I said earlier about encouraging more Gods to be around in order to facilitate these in the first place.&quot;</span>
14:15:51.224595 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Ictinus helped me with a lot of orgreqs one day and I was very thankful for that!&quot;</span>
14:15:58.562183 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alashi says in a pensive voice, &quot;Definitely. Thank you!&quot;</span>
14:16:02.169066 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Eleusis bias.&quot;</span>
14:16:07.066606 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Killian is next!&quot;</span>
14:16:22.039400 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;It was only because I couldn't find the resource hub.&quot;</span>
14:16:26.894788 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Pharaus says in a commanding, deep voice, &quot;A Targ talking about Garden bias.&quot;</span>
14:16:27.253551 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Killian says, &quot;Thank you. There's no secret there's a spectrum of feelings with respect to players and admin, so what have we learned from those challenges? Where are we going towards, regarding the support for all of the diverse subsystems in Achaea?&quot;</span>
14:17:03.986309 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I hope that's already been answered by the general vibe we've been aiming to project over the last weekend.&quot;</span>
14:17:41.165797 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Less dissonance vibe more harmony vibe.&quot;</span>
14:17:41.498581 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Mariko says in a serene, contralto voice, &quot;But what if it hasn't.&quot;</span>
14:17:57.932604 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect smiles and says, &quot;I'm writing a longer answer, don't worry.&quot;</span>
14:17:58.845107 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Killian says, &quot;Specifically? Broad vision? Long-term?&quot;</span>
14:18:11.232653 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Killian laughingly says, &quot;Oh nice, thank you.&quot;</span>
14:18:31.816875 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says to Alyzar, &quot;Let me get Ficus to get the network in here...&quot;</span>
14:18:42.556082 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says to Alyzar, &quot;Harmony spores will sort it all out.&quot;</span>
14:18:45.129359 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Pharaus says in a commanding, deep voice, &quot;I'd say seeing the admins engagement and activity lately is definitely encouraging. Just hope it continues.&quot;</span>
14:18:55.398856 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says to Treyal in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Downvote.&quot;</span>
14:19:04.948572 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante frowns and says to Treyal in a low, rough voice, &quot;I was trying to figure out a way to boomerang bash the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">vines</span><span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;"> yesterday.&quot;</span>
14:19:18.291844 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Ante Did you set the boomerang on fire?&quot;</span>
14:19:22.856859 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Aegoth says just use 'say' and not 'say to'. Please and thank you!&quot;</span>
14:19:24.710152 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says to Alyzar in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Redditor detected.&quot;</span>
14:19:46.493557 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Award Reddit gold to Alyzar.&quot;</span>
14:19:58.429158 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Reddit esteem alyzar.&quot;</span>
14:20:35.743933 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Repairing the relationship between players and admin is basically the number one priority for us. That trickles down from the top to everything in the game basically. Specifically being responsive, available, personable tend to yield the best results here and those of you who know me from Aetolia will hopefully attest that I'm approachable and willing to talk things through with you even if we don't agree on something at any given moment. Mak's already mentioned being more forward about what we're working on. I am aiming to do as much streamlining of systems and processes as I can to make things more efficient and generally have faster turnarounds where possible. And probably the biggest one that I kind of touched on earlier is that basically nothing is off the table when it comes to sensible fixes, QoL updates, etc.&quot;</span>
14:21:20.561901 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;All of that applies to Mak as well. He has an open door policy with messages and concerns, and so do I.&quot;</span>
14:22:21.956754 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Hopefully that more detailed answer sets some concerns at ease.&quot;</span>
14:22:24.811984 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;We on our part, need to make sure we keep in mind you're people, and you can only do so much at once.&quot;</span>
14:22:39.227561 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;I have to do nothing of the sort!&quot;</span>
14:22:41.788504 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Naturally it's easy to say and harder to do. So I'll let our actions speak for themselves on this score as things unfold.&quot;</span>
14:23:05.332295 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Theosis next!&quot;</span>
14:23:07.262966 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis says in a lilting voice, &quot;Can we get promosearch/talismansearch like artsearch, please? Both are incredibly complex and entirely too wide to parse easily, especially on mobile devices. While helping newbies and dropping in often to look things up, it would be much easier to search by keyword and not have to scan through something bigger than my buffer and hope that I catch what I'm looking for. Promo items especially - one section is 6% of the total # of promo items.&quot;</span>
14:23:10.402957 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Killian says, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</span>
14:23:19.782399 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis smiles impishly and says in a lilting voice, &quot;Aaaand I want to take a moment to say that everyone -here- has been nothing short of professional and courteous as far as I've seen - and thank you for putting up with us.&quot;</span>
14:23:28.142763 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;It's on the list and I've actually started looking into it already to try and see how easy it is to do.&quot;</span>
14:23:43.603864 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;As a stopgap, I'd settle for HELP PROMO ITEMS being broken up a bit, for what it's worth.&quot;</span>
14:23:46.347183 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;So yes, we'll have talismansearch at some point, either as its own thing or part of ARTSEARCH umbrella.&quot;</span>
14:23:46.964596 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;It's... a lot.&quot;</span>
14:23:59.250274 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;Oh wow, efficient, i filed that idea a week ago or so.&quot;</span>
14:24:06.778036 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Related, I'm also going to be looking at something similar to LOOKUP from Aetolia to make cross referencing item functions easier to do.&quot;</span>
14:24:14.700361 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Oooooh.&quot;</span>
14:24:27.225966 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Perk emote.&quot;</span>
14:24:31.738799 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis says in a lilting voice, &quot;Artsearch is amazing though as far as feedback goes. I love it!&quot;</span>
14:24:32.310636 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;I typically search the Achaea wiki for promo items and talismans, so that's another stopgap.&quot;</span>
14:24:33.236286 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;That's amazing. I love LOOKUP. It makes crafting there so much easier.&quot;</span>
14:24:33.457453 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Which should also help a lot there, and also eliminate the need to file issues and wait for obscure information to be given out.&quot;</span>
14:24:40.919804 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Did someone say umbrella?&quot;</span>
14:24:43.946435 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Agramon says in a calm, slow voice, &quot;On the subject of talismans and usability, TALISMAN PIECES could really use some love.&quot;</span>
14:24:45.217955 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Rekhyr says in a warm, gravelly voice, &quot;Not knowing Aetolia what is LOOKUP broadly?&quot;</span>
14:24:58.017336 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;And also certain talisman sets that can't be looked up.&quot;</span>
14:25:43.500552 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'm very open to making information as easy to access as possible, so you can expect a lot of updates there in the future.&quot;</span>
14:25:46.025744 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;It's sort of an encyclopedia of things in the game that you can quite literally LOOKUP. So if I forgot what colour a particular gemstone from Djeir is, I can use lookup.&quot;</span>
14:25:58.626923 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Arcturus says, &quot;Gots to poof!&quot;</span>
14:25:59.032888 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Like an in-game wiki?&quot;</span>
14:26:00.109071 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Gallus is next!&quot;</span>
14:26:04.902564 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Molli says with a heavy Cyrenian accent, &quot;Oh, splendid on information accessibility. A lot of the newer/deeper lore feels a bit inscrutable at times. But I might just be lazy.&quot;</span>
14:26:05.686652 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Despite being an older game than Aetolia, Achaea currently has 20 classes while Aetolia has 31. While Achaea has been making several steps in balancing classes with classleads and reworking existing classes, there have been fewer entirely new classes. While I understand the significant amount of work that goes into the production of a new class with its own skills and mechanics, are there any plans for any new classes in the near future?&quot;</span>
14:26:32.085132 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Claes says in a steady, measured voice, &quot;Is that including mirrors?&quot;</span>
14:26:40.555678 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;A lot of those classes are mirrors of each other mechanically which removes the necessity for separate balancing and skill design.&quot;</span>
14:26:48.899610 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I made most of them.&quot;</span>
14:26:58.471178 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios smiles broadly and says, &quot;They're your babies.&quot;</span>
14:27:08.611607 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Let's go Bloodborn enjoyers.&quot;</span>
14:27:20.863220 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Bloodsworn represent.&quot;</span>
14:27:27.122968 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Pretty sure Aetolia only has 18, right? No counting mirrors.&quot;</span>
14:27:32.314985 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Relatively, Achaea has actually had more standalone uniques I think: Depthswalker, Psion, Pariah, Elemental Lords compared to Wayfarer, Bard, Siderealist.&quot;</span>
14:27:37.622587 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;Its hard to compare one to one for classes in general. Because you have things like mirrors but then you also have things like elemental lords and weaponmastery specs, which are sort of classes of their own.&quot;</span>
14:27:48.687029 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;Plus there's the limited number of Achaea classes with city-exclusive abilities, which widens the scope further.&quot;</span>
14:28:12.674794 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;That said, new classes and class overhauls are almost always on the table. It's mostly a matter of inspiration.&quot;</span>
14:28:20.019064 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Mak loves to say no new class this year and then...&quot;</span>
14:28:22.401734 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;What about potentially the ability for some classes to choose their third skill like in Lusternia?&quot;</span>
14:28:27.339714 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Incoming Night Knight.&quot;</span>
14:28:30.183946 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;If we're looking to bring Siderealist here, just saying, has my vote.&quot;</span>
14:28:40.891583 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Annwyn has some wonderful inspiration this time of year. Flutter Ictinus.&quot;</span>
14:28:43.911180 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Archaosa in a low, rough voice, &quot;That gets really hectic here, having played that game mentally it gets very gross.&quot;</span>
14:28:45.035360 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin says, &quot;Warrior...&quot;</span>
14:28:53.759661 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The Hashani martialist spec is also still on the table to be done, yes.&quot;</span>
14:28:53.931013 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Ah, I see.&quot;</span>
14:28:56.774768 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;I would love some &quot;skins&quot; on neutral classes if you're in a faction. Like Evil Monk.&quot;</span>
14:29:01.412661 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;We are not calling it Night Knight though.&quot;</span>
14:29:02.406903 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says to Argwin in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;You want ANOTHER class?&quot;</span>
14:29:04.801308 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alexanderin says in a booming, bass voice, &quot;I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more of the city-based flavor in classes.&quot;</span>
14:29:08.571156 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;I have some ideas for hashan martial, just nothing 100% there yet.&quot;</span>
14:29:14.038909 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says grumpily in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;It should be Night Knight.&quot;</span>
14:29:16.295002 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Atalkez says in a silky, smooth tenor voice, &quot;You can all it what you want but it will be night knight.&quot;</span>
14:29:22.537145 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ulvin says in a quivering voice, &quot;It could be Dark Knight.&quot;</span>
14:29:25.164068 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;I personally dont think new classes need working on... while the current lot we have (as these classleads suggest) some tweeks, here and there.&quot;</span>
14:29:25.737686 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;So very Night Knight.&quot;</span>
14:29:25.902188 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Night isnt a theme in Hashan primarily anymore, but let's see.&quot;</span>
14:29:28.902492 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante looks thoughtful and says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Dark Knight.&quot;</span>
14:29:30.782067 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Shadow Knight!&quot;</span>
14:29:31.659262 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin smiles impishly and says to Eril, &quot;No, I was snarkily correcting Nezaya.&quot;</span>
14:29:36.207639 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says cough* in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Chaos druid *cough*.&quot;</span>
14:29:38.529377 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Moon knight.&quot;</span>
14:29:42.330868 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Warrior doesn't rhyme with Knight, keep up.&quot;</span>
14:29:45.094702 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Tahquil is up next.&quot;</span>
14:29:46.360854 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;We are getting spammy.&quot;</span>
14:29:48.555431 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Or Night.&quot;</span>
14:29:49.538428 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;My first question is in regards to standardization. With some many changes through the years there has been changes to how a syntax will be implemented for similar things. In the future will a style guide be implemented to make syntaxes more innate for players, and more consistent no matter which hands they are passed through?&quot;</span>
14:29:49.743401 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Bleh.&quot;</span>
14:29:49.908639 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Fire sentinel with wild and wacky outer planes animals.&quot;</span>
14:29:54.474945 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ulvin says to Nezaya in a quivering voice, &quot;Shadow Warrior, perfect.&quot;</span>
14:29:54.860927 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;It's not just help files but also in older codes syntaxes like Ship commands, some city commands.. there is just a few I stumble upon every so often. The most egregious examples of this will be the HELP files for talismans. HELP TALISMAN DEATH will bring up the file for the death set but HELP TALISMAN YGGDRASIL/MODERNGODS etc. will fail. As well as how they are written in the list when using HELP 19.&quot;</span>
14:30:13.846793 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;The end, by Tahquil.&quot;</span>
14:30:53.126578 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;He was bashing my UW.&quot;</span>
14:30:58.305366 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Stole his teeth!&quot;</span>
14:30:58.683504 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Vermin.&quot;</span>
14:31:02.009660 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Litterbug.&quot;</span>
14:31:09.406459 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Vultures.&quot;</span>
14:31:09.506816 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Numira says, &quot;Many teef.&quot;</span>
14:31:10.591919 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Fixing things like that will by necessity have to be on a case by case basis, but I know there's a lot of problems with HELPs at the moment. I have a plan for that that might take a while to come to fruition. Syntaxes are probably not going to change much since it tends to confuse people, but again on a case by case basis if there are particularly ornery ones you can file an idea and maybe we can do something like prompt the correct syntax on a common failed command.&quot;</span>
14:31:41.641727 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Coo!&quot;</span>
14:31:42.672672 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;The only tricky thing I have with that is whether to file those as bugs or ideas or etc.&quot;</span>
14:31:45.931286 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;So now would be a good time to start filing typos and issues about that?&quot;</span>
14:31:49.809236 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And better documentation will be a continued ongoing thing.&quot;</span>
14:31:54.234788 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Bunni next!&quot;</span>
14:31:59.868934 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;Hello! Thanks for taking time to meet all of us. There has been a trend of players being enemied to a divine for city conquests for convenient world burning, and then being permanently left on the list. Has this trend been discussed on the staff side?&quot;</span>
14:32:42.015000 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;Over in aetolia, worldburn works off personal enemy lists, which could be a way to address that.&quot;</span>
14:32:58.162657 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;I agree with that.&quot;</span>
14:33:15.794918 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;Maybe, if you take a God's territory, they get angy.&quot;</span>
14:33:19.159957 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;Paranoia beacon condition just becomes no-shrines 2 worldburn boogaloo.&quot;</span>
14:33:27.734493 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;Good..&quot;</span>
14:33:41.775528 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Paranoia should make worldburn hit -everyone-.&quot;</span>
14:33:44.044373 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;No, but its on my list to revisit whether we want worldburn to work in conquest or if it should work the way it does now. We'll talk about that this week. In general my inclination leads towards it somewhat diminishes orders to be used as portable worldburn batteries, but naturally we also want to give orders agency/teeth and don't want to sandbox conquest too much.&quot;</span>
14:33:52.816362 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;So to answer your question we've not talked about it yet, but we will.&quot;</span>
14:33:58.701793 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;Thanks!&quot;</span>
14:34:05.488614 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Makarios in a guttural voice, &quot;Area wide worldburn.&quot;</span>
14:34:07.447750 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Proficy is next.&quot;</span>
14:34:14.264716 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;Worldwide worldburn.&quot;</span>
14:34:17.373351 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Makarios in a guttural voice, &quot;Make worldburn only work on shrines in the area it was initiated.&quot;</span>
14:34:19.033753 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;Set your timeouts, people.&quot;</span>
14:34:25.371815 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says to Proficy in a laboured voice, &quot;Ask the question!&quot;</span>
14:34:29.819227 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Oh me.&quot;</span>
14:34:32.575300 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;I mean, it's WORLDburn, not AREAburn, amirite?&quot;</span>
14:34:38.578364 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;(2) part question....First, In regards to accountability, conduct and behavior. Are there any plans on broadcasting offenses and setting standards in terms of what will be deemed acceptable or not? I mention this because up this point and throughout the existence of IRE. There has always been a level of subjectivity applied to every case. Where if one person does something its punishment to the highest level, but if someone else does the exact same thing, excuses will be made on there behalf. This lack of accountability has led to statements after inappropriate actions, such as &quot;we both know what will happen from that issue&quot;, in regards to them never being addressed and being able to effectively do what they want.&quot;</span>
14:34:40.191465 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Or worlds to burn!&quot;</span>
14:34:44.633790 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Second, I imagine this part will be one of those questions in which &quot;You have a plan for that&quot;, and you will find almost all of my questions will be tied to accountability in some aspect. Anyways, in regards to factional and organizational faith. With the intent to have a more involved &quot;garden&quot; Will people be held accountable to stick true to the beliefs in which they use to act? Many characters use there organizational ties to conduct many actions, yet are not held accountable to upholding themselves to the standards in which they stand for.&quot;</span>
14:36:20.639318 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;A very intense conversation over tea these days, mm.&quot;</span>
14:36:34.501132 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;On the first one - we've recently published the escalation standards for admin punishments and will continue to be adhering to those. Obviously there will always be an element of subjectivity due to the human involvement, but applying the rules fairly and consistently is always the intention. I'm aware that there's a bit of a bad feeling surrounding this lately - I can only really say that we'll aim to be more efficient and consistent to minimise any bad feelings.&quot;</span>
14:37:13.679184 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Proficy, &quot;Do you mean like some groups using room numbers where others have been cred docked for it?&quot;</span>
14:37:32.729992 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;A small suggestion, if i may... in regards to the ISSUE system.... allow counter arguements to be made after initial statements.... to present opportunity to provide additional context.&quot;</span>
14:38:29.253825 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The RP standards question is a bit tougher because several things combine to create these situations, and nobody is perfect. Gods do step in when the circumstances merit it but the bar for that is much higher than it seems from the outside.&quot;</span>
14:38:42.082876 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Atalkez says in a silky, smooth tenor voice, &quot;Need a divine court of justice at this point. State your case to the judge.&quot;</span>
14:38:52.407384 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;That's Kshavatra.&quot;</span>
14:38:52.702108 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Alliances have always been the biggest bugbear here. Splitting these up has always been a difficult thing to do going back years and years.&quot;</span>
14:38:53.848420 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Bring back Miramar.&quot;</span>
14:39:05.575066 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;I understand that.... but i am old school... and my understanding is that it is the Responsibility of the higehest order member, or divine themselves to SET these standards.&quot;</span>
14:39:22.430923 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But personal rp standards are just that. Many characters have reasons to do things that seem at odds to you, and you as players can only police your own or your org's behaviour.&quot;</span>
14:39:38.936083 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;That said I do plan to be a mainly RP-focused Producer, so I think by dint of that things will naturally raise the standard.&quot;</span>
14:39:48.544419 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Molli says with a heavy Cyrenian accent, &quot;Yayyyy!&quot;</span>
14:39:50.380967 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Wooooo.&quot;</span>
14:39:53.839564 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And for posterity, we will not be allowing counter-replies to issues. That is not a road any of us want to go down.&quot;</span>
14:39:54.558090 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;Winning is a hard thing to give up, even if it means not following rp ideals.&quot;</span>
14:39:59.487065 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;More RPZ yes PLZ!&quot;</span>
14:40:02.298706 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;So basically blame Makarios on anything not RP related. Got it.&quot;</span>
14:40:21.589461 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Atalkez is up next.&quot;</span>
14:40:23.984154 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Atalkez says in a silky, smooth tenor voice, &quot;Are there any plans on expanding talisman availability for older and ongoing content? The Talisman shop is missing quite a few items, and even entire sets. The turnover rate is very slow, and even then, many of the biggest items are never listed. Are there any plans to fully add every talisman as available in Delos, on some sort of cadence after a promotion? Missing a promotion for whatever reason or not even having had a character created during the promotion is a terrible reason to miss out on paid content. Also beyond that, it was mentioned slightly earlier and is related, but the amounts and kinds of currency we have is dizzying. Teardrops, bound credits, unbound credits, mayan crowns, delos eagles, talisman pieces, pages, shards - and I imagine I am missing several. Any plans related to that streamlining all of that?&quot;</span>
14:41:14.966233 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Mementoes.&quot;</span>
14:41:17.124461 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Draknathor says, &quot;I didn't even know what a talisman was going into this conversation.&quot;</span>
14:41:22.109425 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Would be kind of nice if there was some kind of shop where you could buy that currency..&quot;</span>
14:41:52.396301 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says to Draknathor, &quot;Heh, you'll be going down a really deep rabbit hole.&quot;</span>
14:42:01.398666 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Expanding the talisman shop is definitely going to happen. Mak and I talked about this earlier today actually. There are improvements that can be made there but we also have to be realistic about the game's model - not every talisman can go in the shop immediately after a promotion, but we definitely can and should do a lot more there. Expect some updates as soon as I have time to go over the ones that are missing.&quot;</span>
14:42:56.145929 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Atalkez says in a silky, smooth tenor voice, &quot;Definitely. I think a fair window post-promotion before 'general' availability is good, but would definitely like to see them get added at some point on a consistent basis. Thanks!&quot;</span>
14:43:01.381683 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The currencies question is somewhat just the nature of the age of the game. I think the best change to be made here is much like the syntax question above: better documentation, making things easier to find and look up, and generally respecting that there's a huge amount of stuff so it should be simple to learn about it.&quot;</span>
14:43:45.389476 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I know there are also a ton of years-old promo items, minipets, limited time things that haven't been made available ever again. I would like to address this as well when time permits.&quot;</span>
14:44:01.730416 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis says in a lilting voice, &quot;BUBBLE PIPES (pop pop pop!).&quot;</span>
14:44:03.223265 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Especially since the mounts and minipets are a much requested tihng to return.&quot;</span>
14:44:04.723415 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And those.&quot;</span>
14:44:06.395539 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Seragorn says, &quot;Damn, I better empty those packs quick time.&quot;</span>
14:44:25.221824 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Have to balance the fact these things are 'rare' for people who do have them too, and they might not like them being made more generally available.&quot;</span>
14:44:41.103826 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;Maybe opening trading of some of those mounts would help?&quot;</span>
14:44:41.510573 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow laughingly says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;I would like a bubble pipe though.&quot;</span>
14:44:43.772303 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'm not sure how we'll tackle it yet.&quot;</span>
14:44:50.274621 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tsia says in a playful voice, &quot;Perhaps some sort of rotational availability in the shop.&quot;</span>
14:44:55.052272 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;I rather like being the only active player with a hydra mount be fair.&quot;</span>
14:44:59.963351 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;OH my god, I put that idea in ages ago and it got rejected. I am so happy.&quot;</span>
14:45:05.911281 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Icraa, &quot;You are not.&quot;</span>
14:45:06.886670 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Personal disagree, especially if said 'rare' items have a significant effect in combat.&quot;</span>
14:45:12.456697 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says to Aranos with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;Has some returned?&quot;</span>
14:45:19.009301 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;I would hug you Ict, but I physicall cant so just know I would.&quot;</span>
14:45:20.495017 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;You could survey to see what people wanted to see - use player feedback (to an extent) to help determine what pops in upcoming promos?&quot;</span>
14:45:21.002831 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Khazeem, I believe.&quot;</span>
14:45:29.351385 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Khaseem.&quot;</span>
14:45:31.993955 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Woudl agree if the rarity is only for items with little to no implications in combat.&quot;</span>
14:45:42.766742 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The next question is an anonymous one: What is going to be done for new Celani to make sure that they feel welcome and that they are getting the knowledge and education that they need to be able to succeed as a Celani and Demigod, etc.?&quot;</span>
14:45:43.062382 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;One of the only then!&quot;</span>
14:46:02.723370 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Havi says in a raspy voice, &quot;Excited to see an influx of new Celani.&quot;</span>
14:46:26.481282 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I touched on this somewhat earlier but the team and process are a lot more streamlined now than in the past and I think we're set up for success. Making it as trouble-free as possible to get through the system is the goal and I think we mostly achieve that nowadays.&quot;</span>
14:46:52.974321 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Numira says to Havi, &quot;Def crossing my fingers for renewed interest for Celani.&quot;</span>
14:47:01.001361 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;I -think-, not having the actual stats in front of me, we lose more people in the actual god phase than in the celani one now.&quot;</span>
14:47:01.165838 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;Other than the email going to you now instead, are there any changes from HELP CELANI?&quot;</span>
14:47:01.284204 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;In my experience, some of the best Celani we've ever had that have gone on to be very successful Gods are those who have had a kind of direct bond with someone in the team that's coached them from the ground up.&quot;</span>
14:47:31.936396 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And I think continuing that for the next generation will work out well. Two of the current played Gods are included in my assessment there. (I'll let you speculate which).&quot;</span>
14:48:18.894711 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Player welcome helps too when a celani becomes a god I'm sure. Being willing to engage with them on their level just seems to make a smoother experience and ease the burden of all their work.&quot;</span>
14:48:23.033663 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Not that they aren't all excellent. But I'm specifically talking about this method of celani progression.&quot;</span>
14:48:29.476518 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And I do think having a direct feedback line via esteem will help a lot.&quot;</span>
14:48:40.196873 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Havi says in a raspy voice, &quot;Not to fan boy or anything - but if I had the experience I would volunteer under the current producer team in a heartbeat. I'm excited, very very excited for the future here.&quot;</span>
14:48:47.141512 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Tentura next!&quot;</span>
14:48:54.911417 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tentura says in a youthful, ardent voice, &quot;Thank you so much for all of your time and energy here! Quick question that might seem elementary here in the wake of so many great questions, are there any plans around marketing or incentivizing returns? Asking so we could be ready and primed of a potential influx of players on or returners on the city and house side, to maximize their experience.&quot;</span>
14:49:48.533066 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Probably not formal marketing but I'm going to look into making a load of common sense updates to the website and doing more engagement across the board with newsletter, discord contests, and so on which should all help with bringing people back.&quot;</span>
14:50:06.657210 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alexanderin says in a booming, bass voice, &quot;As a returner myself, I can say the place just calls to you again somehow.&quot;</span>
14:50:09.806842 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis laughingly says in a lilting voice, &quot;Discord contests! -crosses off list-.&quot;</span>
14:50:57.542357 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;New players is always tough, especially in 2025. But we'll see if there's anything sane we can do there. Marketing has historically been quite unsuccessful though.&quot;</span>
14:51:03.613441 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Claes is next!&quot;</span>
14:51:03.835156 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;I already sang a line from Hotel California.&quot;</span>
14:51:07.668459 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Not gonna do it again.&quot;</span>
14:51:10.118350 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Claes says in a steady, measured voice, &quot;Hi! Thanks for taking time for doing this Townhall! My question is pseudo-classlead related, but I feel it's worth bringing up formally. Because Achaea is an old game, there is a lot of outdated systems that I feel detract from the game, the biggest being statblocks tied to races. Many players feel the need to pick a certain race for PK reasons rather than one that fits the identity of the character they want to play, which gets in the way of roleplaying. As a Human Warrior, I lose out on a very valuable +1 strength that Xoran and Troll get which is worth an entire month of saving up renown just to get that +1 strength for me that I could have otherwise had for free. To extend on that, Tash'la straight up gets +2 constitution, making it a near no-brainer for classes that don't depend on a main stat.&quot;</span>
14:51:11.578082 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;I got pulled in from the 8-Bit Theater ad drop back in the day but that's part of an internet scene that no longer really exists.&quot;</span>
14:51:15.288472 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Claes says in a steady, measured voice, &quot;Right now I have a newbie in the Shield who is an extremely unoptimal race for the class they chose to play and it feels awful to say in an IG medium that 'You're going to struggle to fight because the race you picked for your class is incompatible.' Further, how am I even supposed to say that IG? It's a very uncomfortable spot to be in as someone who advocates for RP &gt; min/max as a low-paying player. I know trait/spec is supposed to help this, but I feel it isn't enough. Is this something feasible that could be changed or looked into?&quot;</span>
14:51:42.739916 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Oh, I agreed on that one.&quot;</span>
14:51:45.805039 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says to Zenui, &quot;I'm pretty sure I was the same.&quot;</span>
14:51:47.011897 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I have 'look into expansion for race specs' on the list.&quot;</span>
14:51:47.244692 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Please statpacks forever...&quot;</span>
14:51:59.606319 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Havi says in a raspy voice, &quot;Seconding statpacks.&quot;</span>
14:52:17.422930 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah laughingly says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;I mean, I left the Shield my first time there, because I was told my race made it impossible for my class to be good at combat, and I can tell you tehre isn't a good way to say it.&quot;</span>
14:52:18.508387 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Make them go visit their alchemist npcs to change their stat points if this is put in.&quot;</span>
14:52:22.735955 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;If such a system were put in place, would people potentially have a free racial reset, given their choices may have been made with stats in mind?&quot;</span>
14:52:26.175620 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;We probably won't be doing statpacks but if there are improvements to the existing system then that'd be more practical.&quot;</span>

14:52:42.369219 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Molli says with a heavy Cyrenian accent, &quot;NPC? Why not a real alchemist? I volunteer!&quot;</span>
14:52:47.755873 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I don't hate statpacks but your player race mattering has always been one of those Achaea charms.&quot;</span>

14:53:01.512438 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;That said I think we can ease some of the outlier burdens.&quot;</span>
14:53:13.372976 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;You could survey to see what people wanted to see - use player feedback (to an extent) to help determine what pops in upcoming promos?&quot;</span>
14:53:19.642141 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;Sorry! oops.&quot;</span>
14:53:24.180285 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;A point buy system? I don't think that'd be monetized..&quot;</span>

14:53:51.371045 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alexanderin says in a booming, bass voice, &quot;Racial bonuses are much better balanced now. Rajas used to get faster balance recovery, so...&quot;</span>
14:53:57.236514 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Bunni in a low, rough voice, &quot;Im picturing it more like a dnd level up style, optimistically.&quot;</span>
14:54:14.668972 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;Its been great to see how often new races are added to Aetolia and how much creative input players get when changing to a sort of evolved race at higher levels or customising race skills. Similarly, the ability to modify how a classs attacks appearthrough those customisation scrolls, I believewas a fantastic way to let players shape their characters to better fit their vision. Are there any plans to expand similar creative options in Achaea, whether through more customisation for race appearances, class abilities, or other aspects of player presentation?&quot;</span>
14:54:34.792838 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;I'll never understand why they added kobold as a race..&quot;</span>

14:55:15.783736 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Yes. We do have custom battlerage now but something like styles might feature here at some point, along with other creative options that make sense.&quot;</span>
14:55:15.961928 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;I can't remember what they're called, but I loved getting to reimagine my character when I hit level 100.&quot;</span>

14:56:46.382502 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.&quot;</span>
14:56:47.494626 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;I'm guessing room numbers.&quot;</span>
14:56:49.759335 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I would prefer you not call them vnums, but coordinates is fine.&quot;</span>

14:58:08.230346 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;He queued twice.&quot;</span>
14:58:15.788930 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Glare anton.&quot;</span>
14:58:15.909112 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Something like &quot;Come to me, I'm at (place) coordinates 42069.&quot;</span>
14:58:16.363251 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;Ok.&quot;</span>
14:58:19.924714 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;Said with love.&quot;</span>
14:58:23.436035 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;I promise.&quot;</span>
14:58:27.914144 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;Some people feel that events in recent years have become increasingly railroaded, and that deviating from what feels like a preplanned event trajectory is punished by divine- who then in turn fall back on excuses like &quot;of course disagreeing with such a powerful denizen would lead to consequences&quot;, etc. I understand that you have a balance between trying to tell a coherent story and engaging the playerbase, but I'm going to back up the person who asked me to ask this. As a leader, I have often felt like my choices were limited to &quot;complete non-engagement with the story and possible RP punishment for it&quot; or &quot;Basically doing exactly what the god-denizen wants.&quot; and I am happy to back that up with several years' worth of examples. My question is simply- can you acknowledge that's an issue and, as you start to take over primary direction for Achaea's story, make a commitment to try and err less on the side of railroading or creating inflexible situations?&quot;</span>
14:58:44.834838 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;We've already talked about it.&quot;</span>
14:58:48.494459 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;I sense spores.&quot;</span>
14:59:32.789068 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'm responding to you, just give me a moemnt.&quot;</span>
15:00:06.497108 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;We've already talked about the event direction thing. I'm a big fan of player agency in story events as much as we can feasibly allow. Obviously sometimes the direction isn't going to be able to be massively derailed, especially if there's a content release or system tied to it.&quot;</span>
15:00:51.869005 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But I tend to fall on the side of letting things go in the way they go organically as much as we possibly can. That means player decisions affecting the plot. Less railroading. More actual involvement in the story too across the board instead of denzien wants help and denizen says jump and denizen gets the credit.&quot;</span>
15:01:00.747861 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;You've already seen how much I enjoy minigames for example.&quot;</span>
15:01:06.459210 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Oh really.&quot;</span>
15:01:07.965428 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;I didnt notice.&quot;</span>
15:01:12.145606 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Heh.&quot;</span>
15:01:28.312899 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;There was a bit of a meta over some of the past events - and I loved the events - where the resolution was deus ex machina.&quot;</span>
15:01:32.215760 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;More systems to interface with story and actually contribute/participate will be an ongoing high priority though.&quot;</span>
15:01:48.059286 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I want to put more into player hands than just watching a scene, but obviously this is all with the big caveat that sometimes we can't.&quot;</span>
15:01:53.844536 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;I loved the events but the finale was kind of a gut punch.&quot;</span>
15:02:02.142142 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Antoninus says, &quot;Thank you for hearing me out on this, I know it's a hard question.&quot;</span>
15:02:16.779632 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;It's not. I agree with the premise entirely.&quot;</span>
15:02:31.013869 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I think a lot of the problem from our side there has been resources at times but also scope of what's possible.&quot;</span>
15:02:33.113267 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Let him feel antagonistic!&quot;</span>
15:02:47.310932 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Menetta says in a modulated, velvet voice, &quot;500 flavors of death in the book event definitely discouraged me.&quot;</span>
15:02:50.882349 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Boo, hiss!&quot;</span>
15:02:52.401161 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ylvarie says in a sweet, melodic voice, &quot;Snicker Treyal.&quot;</span>
15:03:09.739737 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The team as things stand now are a lot more savvy on how to make an event more interactive and player-participation-heavy than before I think. So yes, expect a lot here.&quot;</span>
15:03:17.726785 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Menetta says to Theosis in a modulated, velvet voice, &quot;Time it was happening, I was trying to level up to my logosian, and getting repeatedly killed as part of an event was super discouraging.&quot;</span>
15:03:26.066905 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Tahquil up next.&quot;</span>
15:03:31.814723 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;So my second question was answered with Idea threads on discord being confirmed I'mm move to the third and I am sorry for the salt.&quot;</span>
15:03:34.845422 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;It's not a Q&amp;A session unless I ask this question. Everyone say it together. MAHOGANY VICES. Once a SoW items that compressed iconic shards together to make strengthening House Icons less tedious. House icons and the iconic shards have been defunct since 671AF but each time I have bought up the issue of mahogany vices having had no use for nearly 300 years the answer has been either &quot;We don't have the authority to issue blanket refunds, only the higher ups can&quot; or &quot;We have plans to give them another use this year.&quot;&quot;</span>

15:03:43.098943 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Since every level of administration is present now, can we get refunds on these mahogany vices that have been sitting in our inventories useless since 2014? If they do get a new use, cool, I'll rebuy it if it applies to me but it sucks having it just there as a just-in-case item.&quot;</span>

My question was going to be about mining, but Ictinus has already addressed that in maincord. So this is my other question: I - and others - have had issues with inclusion in events because of time zones. In the past, whenever I've asked about it I've essentially been shut down, and things have continued along the same lines. I want to know if you have plans on being more inclusive of the non-American world and allow us to participate in events. I don't mind staying up once in a while, over a weekend or something, but it's hard with work and kids and such and cannot - for me anyway - be a regular occurrence. But I would love to be included and thought of when plans are made, and so would so many others.&quot;</span>

15:08:18.774488 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But we also have to be realistic that when it comes to the really big stuff, those are almost always going to be concluding in prime time just because of the lion's share of the playerbase being available.&quot;</span>
15:08:42.629671 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Nezaya next!&quot;</span>

Last summer there was a teaser about a House overhaul and a lore dump on Magic and probably some other things. I thought that was supposed to be in Q4 but it seems to not have happened due to a lot of other fun stuff instead. Is it still intended to occur and do we know what part of the year it's targeted for?&quot;</span>
15:09:08.625076 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Dunno if they're still here, I wrote that at the beginning and I'm changing nothing about it.&quot;</span>
15:09:17.083299 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Someone powerful says, &quot;Still here.&quot;</span>
15:09:23.180779 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Seragorn says, &quot;Thats so hot.&quot;</span>
15:09:25.107103 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Good to see ya! Metaphorically!&quot;</span>
15:09:27.844681 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;It's still on the list but part of why it hasn't manifested is that a lot of the implementation and plan for it never really worked out in a way that we were happy with at all.&quot;</span>
15:10:02.744023 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Do you have anything else to tease about it? It was a pretty exciting concept.&quot;</span>
15:10:05.798511 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;We got a trailer, maybe?&quot;</span>
15:10:16.585096 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Karalden says in a sonorous, resonant voice, &quot;Drop the hype trailer.&quot;</span>
15:10:17.627193 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;So we're probably going to revisit the idea from the ground up and see what we come up with. It's probably not going to happen in the immediate future, but some of the tangential parts of it - expanded class lore in particular - will be going forward.&quot;</span>
15:10:35.271104 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Hmm a teaser.&quot;</span>
15:10:37.753423 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Havi says in a raspy voice, &quot;Who said Sarapis' name three times?&quot;</span>
15:10:56.059324 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;I think that is one of those things communication wise people are excited for changing. I know a lot of house stuff has not been focused on across the game for fear of it not mattering when it changes.&quot;</span>
15:11:11.300037 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;And not knowing when that change would happen.&quot;</span>
15:11:12.933422 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;I'm guilty of that, yeah.&quot;</span>
15:11:24.779195 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I guess it won't hurt here to reveal this but one of the archetype ideas we had for the magic organisation was to be able to visit an NPC and get, say, a lesson on one of the shaman spiritlore spirits.&quot;</span>
15:11:35.925827 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Houses in general are in a rough place, leadership is a lot of work and competent leadership is very diffusively spread throughout the game...&quot;</span>
15:11:36.029102 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Which ties into the above - delivering class lore in a sane IC way is something I want to do a lot more of.&quot;</span>
15:11:37.760793 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says to Nezaya in a quiet voice, &quot;Time to make a high clan. Achaea magic lore meets Witcher Brotherhood of Sorcerers political backstabbing.&quot;</span>
15:11:43.458353 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Fear is th ekiller of innovation - or something.&quot;</span>
15:11:55.272905 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Aroan is up next!&quot;</span>
15:11:57.525727 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Ew, High Clan. We don't need High Clans, we got houses.&quot;</span>
15:11:58.452627 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aroan says, &quot;This one is for Matt and Jeremy. To preface - I really appreciate the amount of energy that Icti and Mak have been putting into improving player/admin relations the past several days, and the QoL features have all been fantastic. However I'm having a hard time with the idea that the absence of all of this activity was solely due to Nicola, and surely the state of player/admin relations weren't a surprise to you both. With that in mind and recognizing that IRE's revenue is closely related to player retention and sentiment, are there any changes you're considering at the IRE leadership level beyond adding Icti as the new co-producer to support Achaea's long term health?&quot;</span>
15:12:00.032649 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;And thanks, Icti.&quot;</span>
15:12:04.694974 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aroan says, &quot;I ask that hoping that I can be a paying player in an active and healthy game a decade from now.&quot;</span>
15:12:39.098581 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says, &quot;The IRE leadership level is me and jeremy, that's it, heh.&quot;</span>
15:12:47.146276 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Seragorn says, &quot;Icti is enough, we need nothing more.&quot;</span>
15:12:50.408700 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says, &quot;Mainly Jeremy as I'm not that involved day to day.&quot;</span>

15:14:14.948414 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says to Aroan, &quot;I hope you can be too!&quot;</span>
15:14:21.977373 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;I think he is asking why all of this QoL seemingly happened in under a week if it was not happening before.&quot;</span>
15:14:25.136367 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says to Aroan, &quot;But to be honest, I have a -terrible- record of predicting Achaea's lifespan.&quot;</span>
15:14:33.699434 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says, &quot;When I launched Achaea in 1997 I gave us 5 years.&quot;</span>
15:14:54.329051 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says, &quot;Because Achaea has new leadership.&quot;</span>
15:15:09.657787 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says, &quot;This has all happened since Ictinus and Makarios became co lead producers.&quot;</span>

15:16:46.784346 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;A lot of these things have been stuff players have been asking for for years.&quot;</span>

15:17:12.546808 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;The burst of energy is good to see. The previous response times were not good. I had issues take 3-4 real months to get looked at. That has improved dramatically in a short span of time, beginning right before the leadership change.&quot;</span>
15:17:23.679530 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Missed opportunity for &quot;Jumpy jumps in from nowhere&quot;.&quot;</span>
15:17:24.609522 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says, &quot;Sure, but players also ask for stuff -all the time- so you could say that about 99 things for every 1 that's being implemented.&quot;</span>
15:17:43.897063 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;It's really just a matter of priorities and refocusing things. Coming in with a clean slate gives me a much different perspective since I am somewhat presented with an empty board to add things to rather than an already full plate.&quot;</span>
15:17:53.987243 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sarapis, the Logos says, &quot;This is all a result of a new leadership that has new priorities.&quot;</span>
15:18:08.126619 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya smiles impishly and says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Enjoy the empty board while it lasts, I guess.&quot;</span>
15:18:24.825084 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Havi says in a raspy voice, &quot;I also hope that you guys get enough rest to avoid burnout yourselves. Your plates are full and we are all very thankful for the work you are doing but we do not want to see you get burnt out at all.&quot;</span>
15:19:02.724092 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;So ultimately yeah, it's really just me having a brand new list to start from and I chose to start with these.&quot;</span>
15:19:33.210203 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Maedhros next!&quot;</span>
15:19:38.345917 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Maedhros says in a resonant voice, &quot;Thanks.&quot;</span>
15:19:46.893712 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Maedhros says in a resonant voice, &quot;Looks like the current mining system has led to a monopoly on certain commodities. Any plans to adjust the mining system or city economies? If so, what kind of changes can we expect? Also... Are there any plans to update PK rules and scrolls related to hiring a mark?&quot;</span>
15:21:02.313422 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'll be opening a thread after this for mining feedback, but yes we're not happy with how it is currently so there'll be changes in the pipeline.&quot;</span>
15:21:24.926631 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;If I could emote, I'd cheer. But know feeling is there.&quot;</span>
15:21:32.033920 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alexanderin says in a booming, bass voice, &quot;I first started here in '99 and the economy is crazy these days.&quot;</span>
15:21:38.957870 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Woooo ! cheering!&quot;</span>
15:21:40.770676 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Back in my day...&quot;</span>
15:21:42.647331 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Mariko says in a serene, contralto voice, &quot;Ok boomer.&quot;</span>
15:21:43.509488 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ita says in a low, smoky voice, &quot;That's exciting to hear. Woo!&quot;</span>
15:21:50.528397 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I have some thoughts on the economy on a broader scale - gold sinks for example - but nothing to share here immediately other than the fact we're aware of it.&quot;</span>
15:22:03.348488 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ylvarie says to Alexanderin in a sweet, melodic voice, &quot;Ain't that just the way.&quot;</span>
15:22:09.366275 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Hopefully that makes more of the conjugation reasonable to actually make instead of relying on rurin.&quot;</span>
15:22:11.157995 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Re: PK rules. HELP PK should generally be up to date. If there are problems or confusion here, send in an issue and I can take a look at what's not accurate.&quot;</span>
15:22:30.331928 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Don't pay for conjugation.&quot;</span>
15:22:37.408384 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;I think that's in relation to not having any way to retaliate if your mines are attacked and legions lost.&quot;</span>
15:22:44.085704 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Synbios next!&quot;</span>
15:22:46.938854 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;This recent Classlead round was amazing, with a ton of entries and a spike of activity thanks to linking the classlead submissions to Discord. I enjoyed that we could also discuss said changes OOCly and in real-time. Will we be seeing more frequent classlead rounds in the future and can we expect additional QoL improvements and/or New Things(tm) to the classlead system?&quot;</span>
15:22:47.166421 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Maedhros says in a resonant voice, &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;</span>
15:23:07.534022 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says to Makarios in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;We're so sorry by the way.&quot;</span>
15:24:05.228102 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says to Alyzar, &quot;Why be sorried, I'm sure Mak loved your 520 comment conversation on quicklocks.&quot;</span>
15:24:26.996466 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;While Mak writes up a response about classleads as a whole, I just wanted to reiterate that I'll be opening a QoL suggestions thread right after this.&quot;</span>
15:24:31.143283 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;On the Achaea Discord.&quot;</span>
15:25:06.562248 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;More regular, yes. We'll try to get these on a schedule, though sometimes those inevitably flux (for example, I don't really like running classleads during war or major pk events). They probably won't be quite as big as this one usually, we'll likely go back down to a seven classlead cap next time but I was conscious we missed the planned one from December due to events conspiring.&quot;</span>
15:25:11.334266 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Mariko says in a serene, contralto voice, &quot;I like the fancy setup on Discord, much admiration.&quot;</span>
15:25:16.915119 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alexanderin says in a booming, bass voice, &quot;I need to haul my boomer self into 2020 at least and get on Discord.&quot;</span>
15:25:48.951239 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Asmodron is up!&quot;</span>
15:25:51.834717 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Doom.&quot;</span>
15:25:58.495261 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;I'm happy to hear that. Thanks, Ictinus and Makarios!&quot;</span>
15:26:06.247614 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Pharaus says in a commanding, deep voice, &quot;How many questions are left in the queue?&quot;</span>
15:26:09.815516 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Not sure if this has already been mentioned, but one of the bigger issues I've noticed in Achaea is the lack of activity, or sometimes purpose, that cities/orgs can suffer over long periods. This often stems from a heavy reliance on active patrons to drive narratives and activity forward. As a comparison with games like Lusternia and Aetolia, cities have built-in mechanics that foster ongoing RP engagement like denizen hunts/worship, large-scale city quests, or even mobs raiding villages. Could Achaea incorporate similar RP-driven activities, allowing players to immerse themselves in their chosen org themes without needing volunteer assistance?&quot;</span>
15:26:42.717530 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;There are 13 more in the queue currently.&quot;</span>
15:26:49.641934 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Oh yeah, can we get mobs raiding villages? That sounds great. I know nothing about this mechanic but it was always fun in other games that had it.&quot;</span>
15:26:50.115502 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'm happy to keep going though, so if you want to join, feel free.&quot;</span>
15:26:50.972270 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;I thought we already had mobs raiding cities. Ey-oh!&quot;</span>
15:27:24.096173 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Theosis says in a lilting voice, &quot;I have to head out so just gonna drop this here but erm.&quot;</span>
15:27:33.264139 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Theosis in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Denied.&quot;</span>
15:27:37.321048 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;I'm going to veto the Delos sale, actually.&quot;</span>
15:27:40.281738 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Turns denizen villages into like high-intensity bashing grounds.&quot;</span>
15:27:52.254577 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;I suppose Delos Sale.&quot;</span>
15:27:57.880086 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Nezaya in a guttural voice, &quot;Sounds like you need to start bashing commune and UW.&quot;</span>
15:28:03.753248 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;I'd rather be able to spend my credits on my time rather than waiting 6 months for a sale.&quot;</span>
15:28:14.076748 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alexanderin says in a booming, bass voice, &quot;Personally, I feel like we the players, as people in a game with player run everything, bear just as much of the burden of keeping RP in our cities fresh and constant.&quot;</span>
15:28:15.862874 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Proficy in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;You already staked claim on UW and called us vermin!&quot;</span>
15:28:18.843503 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante looks surprised and says in a low, rough voice, &quot;It's an actual safe Havyn now.&quot;</span>
15:28:20.549022 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I answered this partly already during an earlier question I think. But yes I want to be able to do more for orgs without needing the God to be involved. I would point at the lab though as an example of a massive RP tool that almost perfectly fits this request. More stuff like that = good and on the table definitely.&quot;</span>
15:28:24.055062 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;More about getting bashing stuff going that isn't like 'hi, I'm RPing a psychopath today.'&quot;</span>
15:28:31.923448 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Lupisentia says to Alexanderin in a smooth, confident voice, &quot;Agreed.&quot;</span>
15:28:38.391222 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;I liked buying saving up 6000 renown-credits to buy level 3 strength at 500 credtis off..&quot;</span>
15:28:42.226986 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Havyn laughingly says to Ante in a silvery voice, &quot;You could not help yourself..could you?&quot;</span>
15:28:57.234555 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Especially if they have conflict potential. That is a bit of a delicate one and we have to be careful not to repeat the mistakes of the engagement systems from Aetolia (if you know, you know...).&quot;</span>
15:29:33.788954 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But yes, very open to this. As a big blanket statement I'm happy to say that rp and immersion and atmosphere are my highest prios for the game. Oniar shouts for example. Or the coming update to custom denizen honours...&quot;</span>
15:29:40.766764 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Eril is up!&quot;</span>
15:30:11.458959 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;As far as the Gods are concerned, is there any planning to more deliniating of the Divine paths and ideals in the works? Some like Gaia and Sartan are rather easy to identify and clarify, but I can say that due to my past roles, I faced a lot of difficulty explaining the differences between for example say Phaestus and Scarlatti due to their similarities and overlaps in historical claims and lore by different Players of the God or Order Heads. I'm not saying either God or their Lore unnecessary, but is it seen as a necessary step to better clarify some of their realms and areas of focus? To this end, is there any plans to do similar clarification and isolation of areas of focus for cities?&quot;</span>
15:30:39.377557 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;On top of that, is there any thoughts on taking active control of some Gods denizens sometimes to breathe life and relevance into those Orders while a new &quot;God&quot; is found? If this is a similar point to Asmodron's, please disregards!&quot;</span>
15:30:50.221661 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;We're just gonna say 'custom denizen honours' and then move along.&quot;</span>
15:30:57.782076 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;On a complete other topic...much easier question...can we get polearms? Thank you very much for your time today!&quot;</span>
15:31:03.184623 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;I love the latter part of that question.&quot;</span>
15:31:05.952285 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Not the polearm bit.&quot;</span>
15:31:09.463843 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;Hater.&quot;</span>
15:31:13.059436 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says sweetly to Nezaya, &quot;Find out IG.&quot;</span>
15:31:35.427196 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Can't find out coming updates yet.&quot;</span>
15:31:44.568924 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Glaive or death, glaive or death..&quot;</span>
15:31:44.922934 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya sticks out her tongue and says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Cause pending.&quot;</span>
15:31:55.216772 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;Halberd halberd halberd.&quot;</span>
15:31:56.845875 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Night Knight gets a polearm.&quot;</span>
15:32:02.091687 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;That would largely depend on the god in question and whether they have an active volunteer. Usually a new God does a lot of legwork in clarifying old lore or forgotten details. The new Scarlatti in particular has done a great job here, so tentatively yes I guess, but with some caveats on activity. God denizens are usually off limits to not-god-player for a reason, but I've always been a bit more relaxed about that if the circumstances demand it.&quot;</span>
15:32:05.588294 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin sticks out his tongue and says, &quot;I have a bardiche stashed away in a stasis room.&quot;</span>
15:32:07.701102 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Yes, Night Knight gets the sword on a stick.&quot;</span>
15:32:08.209504 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Havi says to Gallus in a raspy voice, &quot;They call that Carnifex.&quot;</span>
15:32:09.199589 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;I want to stab you but I also want you nowhere near me.&quot;</span>
15:32:22.454550 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;That is to say, i wouldn't expect a full sit down with an order NPC if the God is obviously not active. But we can do a bit more than just radio silence here.&quot;</span>
15:32:30.127379 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Tahquil has got the idea.&quot;</span>
15:32:42.831817 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Polearms: ask Mak if he wants to make a polearm class I suppose!&quot;</span>
15:32:50.589018 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;Use know-nothing denizens, no one expects Bertram the Sewer Worker to have a correct sense of lore or theology.&quot;</span>
15:32:51.294134 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Cavalier weaponspec.&quot;</span>

15:32:54.412812 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Social distancing without giving up murder.&quot;</span>
15:32:56.984267 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Hey Makarios, want to make a polearm class?&quot;</span>
15:33:00.681921 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Karalden says in a sonorous, resonant voice, &quot;Nightknight.&quot;</span>

15:33:21.703797 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Karalden says to Ante in a sonorous, resonant voice, &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;</span>
15:33:23.254964 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Long as I can learn the weapon proficiency.&quot;</span>
15:33:26.499469 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Yilui says, &quot;Polearms are cool!&quot;</span>
15:33:29.619017 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Seragorn says, &quot;Evade into polearm doublestabs from the adjacent room, possible serp solution.&quot;</span>
15:33:29.861487 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous laughingly says, &quot;Short answer is yes, long answer is I want to make many things, and that list is getting very long.&quot;</span>
15:33:31.770210 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Menetta says to Eril in a modulated, velvet voice, &quot;Night Knight.&quot;</span>
15:33:39.763178 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Yeeeeeesss.&quot;</span>
15:33:41.007575 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;So its a matter of prioritisation where classes are concerned.&quot;</span>
15:33:51.707515 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Yilui says, &quot;Stop making me want to move to Hashan.&quot;</span>

15:33:53.646108 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;We're taking turns right?&quot;</span>
15:33:56.450016 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Druid rework first.&quot;</span>
15:33:59.116963 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;Thank you all again.&quot;</span>
15:34:02.024248 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante looks thoughtful and says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Light knight.&quot;</span>
15:34:02.742646 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;Oceans have been nerfed more and more due to various reasons which makes them more and more unattractive, it was supposed to be a big risk, big reward thing, due to the fact that you could always be attacked, but now it feels like it has become a big risk, mid reward thing, in addition 2 voyages are currently unplayable due to a new, anti grief mechanic with unintended consequences which makes Maya's Sundered </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:fuchsia;">Pearl</span><span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;"> unsalvagable because no one has captain perms to salvage it. Which makes the oceanic content somewhat lacking for us more experienced players. Will the oceans get more love, via new areas, monsters, voyages, or new challenges in general any time soon? Maybe even new ship type, or reworking the current ones? Because right now the cutters are pretty much useless unless you like to have a beachfront house, or like to spin really fast in a circle, and the difference between a strider and a galley is huge.&quot;</span>
15:34:05.971104 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Got a follow up from Eril's question.&quot;</span>
15:34:11.384848 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;I also know if we gave polearms to a factional there would be pitchforks of a different kind...&quot;</span>
15:34:12.022167 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Agreed, delete ships.&quot;</span>
15:34:17.442330 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin says to Blackwillow, &quot;Druids wielding polearms?&quot;</span>

15:34:25.794787 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says to Makarios in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;That's a good thing!&quot;</span>
15:34:27.477659 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;A staff is a polearm.&quot;</span>
15:34:38.400914 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;Not a cool one though.&quot;</span>
15:34:43.917046 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;That is true.&quot;</span>
15:34:44.603598 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Paladins deserve polearms, they both start with P.&quot;</span>
15:34:46.649058 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;It is not a cool one.&quot;</span>
15:34:51.988105 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui sticks out his tongue and says, &quot;Make polearms exclusive to the Guild of Knights.&quot;</span>
15:34:55.083715 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Elmer says, &quot;And I'm ALWAYS fighting Yudhi so good luck doing old rak.&quot;</span>
15:34:58.415817 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says to Alyzar in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;Nope, you got priests instead.&quot;</span>
15:34:59.325223 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;On the whole I would be more open to new voyages, quests, rewards, and such than major overhauls to the actual ship system itself.&quot;</span>
15:35:04.909023 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Zenui in a low, rough voice, &quot;As a knight guild hater i like this a lot.&quot;</span>
15:35:23.066046 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says to Makarios, &quot;Thats okay. the poearms will have equl reach to the pitchforms so the battlefield is even.&quot;</span>
15:35:30.762006 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Windcutters need love though, you can't even reliable kill seamonsters in it.&quot;</span>
15:35:33.330277 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Including potentially new areas to discover, though these are a lot of work and not a short term prospect.&quot;</span>
15:35:39.013939 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alexanderin says in a booming, bass voice, &quot;Two-hander weaponmastery users of any class could make use of glaives, halberds, etc. Just saying.&quot;</span>
15:35:45.127114 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Yilui says, &quot;New areas?!&quot;</span>
15:35:47.655981 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Yeah, still surprised no new islands after Himalia's thing.&quot;</span>
15:36:00.748869 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Side comments to a minimum.&quot;</span>
15:36:10.259033 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ita says in a low, smoky voice, &quot;Exciting!&quot;</span>
15:36:14.209101 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Neugierig says in a subtle, slightly-raspy voice, &quot;Very.&quot;</span>
15:36:17.787370 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;More than able to start a room party.&quot;</span>
15:36:26.470461 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin says, &quot;Something something hall monitors something or other...&quot;</span>
15:36:28.104287 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says to Ictinus with a short, clipped accent, &quot;More seafaring will always be cool.&quot;</span>
15:36:30.409622 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;To NOT drown the room with chatter.&quot;</span>
15:36:31.763772 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But if there are major pain points in the system then we can look into it. I'll admit to being a little under-educated when it comes to ship specifics, so I might seek some feedback here and see what can be done sanely.&quot;</span>
15:36:31.928025 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Eril says in a deep and rumbling voice, &quot;Fraid I must depart...probably stayed longer then should, but appreciate this very much!&quot;</span>
15:36:33.954608 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says to Ictinus with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;That sounds really exciting! I'm gonna file a new voyagebug for the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:fuchsia;">Pearl</span><span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;"> later if you'd prefer that.&quot;</span>
15:36:40.028581 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says to Icraa, &quot;Please do yep.&quot;</span>
15:36:48.818654 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Ita next!&quot;</span>
15:36:51.115243 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ita says in a low, smoky voice, &quot;First and foremost, I just want to say: Thank you all for your time, dedication, and investment into this game. For all the hard work, growing pains, and effort put in. I have no doubt it is a struggle at time. So, thank you so much, well meet, and I am eagerly look forward to whats ahead. I had questions. Most of my questions have been answered, so I guess - thank you for all the answers! Also, I love this new system of Esteem. It's been a personal hurdle for myself - in just wanting to appreciate people and Garden. And many changes made so far. Thank you, again! So, my question is: When a player or group is at an impasse in a RP (I am thinking mostly small scale stuff), and need some clarity or advice, on how to pursue or go about it - or might need some minor assistance to proceed forward, how should we go about asking this? Especially if they do not have access to such things as org/patron requests, or it really is just not big enough for such a bother? Is it okay to reach out? If so, who and how? What would you recommend to do? I hope that made sense. Sorry, if it's a bit rambling.&quot;</span>
15:37:33.136954 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;In that case I would normally recommend seeking advice from other players or your patron if you have one.&quot;</span>
15:38:25.222595 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Sometimes bringing it up to denizens might also be viable but it depends on the situation. For the most part I think these type of personal rp arcs should be handled player to player as much as possible, but that said, if you are just wanting a bit of input or advice then I'm usually happy to talk, time permitting.&quot;</span>
15:38:59.116499 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I will go on the record though and say one thing I want to avoid is the idea of big meandering meetings about city or org direction. I don't think those are ever productive so if you have legitimate factional concerns, those are best raised to me in a detailed email.&quot;</span>
15:39:09.900372 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I know you didn't ask about that but I think it's an important one to cover.&quot;</span>
15:39:15.945051 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;So important.&quot;</span>
15:39:28.027668 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Alashi is up!&quot;</span>
15:39:36.297581 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alashi says in a pensive voice, &quot;Relaying this question for someone who couldn't be here. What might it look like for Achaea, were we to follow Lusternia and the like into legacy mode? Though I'm quite hopeful that that won't happen anytime soon!&quot;</span>
15:39:37.248711 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ita says in a low, smoky voice, &quot;Thank you for the answer!&quot;</span>
15:39:46.661643 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Sorry.&quot;</span>
15:39:48.169201 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Someone powerful says, &quot;I've got to take off everyone. I'll be back occasionally at future Tea Times! Metaphorically. And actually.&quot;</span>
15:40:00.086747 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Thank you someone!&quot;</span>

15:40:22.716537 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Going back to assuming he's not real now.&quot;</span>
15:40:30.694282 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;To be fair.&quot;</span>
15:40:30.864092 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Never was.&quot;</span>
15:40:32.946573 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Was he ever?&quot;</span>
15:40:36.090236 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Who?&quot;</span>
15:40:39.656311 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Owls.&quot;</span>
15:40:41.214455 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I don't think any of us really know what Legacy Achaea would look like. I don't see that happening any time in the near future though, but if it did I would imagine a major downscaling and focus on maintenance.&quot;</span>
15:40:42.207989 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Xarthus says, &quot;Heh.&quot;</span>
15:40:51.824205 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Ahaha.&quot;</span>
15:40:52.985041 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Just like the voices.&quot;</span>
15:41:12.064566 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Veldrin!&quot;</span>
15:41:13.247191 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Any thoughts about copying skills/systems from the other IRE games? Like the influence system from Lusternia or any of the different crafting skills? Example being Imperian's woodcarving. Also some of us started learning dragon before Ashaxei were killed, can we please get to continue learning that?&quot;</span>
15:41:13.501637 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alashi says in a pensive voice, &quot;Thanks!&quot;</span>
15:41:38.990370 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Saibel says in a clear voice, &quot;The influence and debate system from there is amazing.&quot;</span>
15:41:39.097932 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zephyl says with a Baarian accent, &quot;Give us spaceships from Starmourne.&quot;</span>
15:41:48.059329 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Do you mean the dragon language?&quot;</span>
15:41:56.916228 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says something unintelligible.</span>
15:42:04.665323 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Kasotus says to Zephyl, &quot;Keep building that NONT ladder and we may have use for them.&quot;</span>
15:42:06.613926 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I thought that was still possible to do via Sycaerunax.&quot;</span>
15:42:07.362877 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Ashaxei taught it before, but Sycaerunax doesn't.&quot;</span>
15:42:11.376399 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Xarthus says, &quot;They would fit right in here, medieval spaceships.&quot;</span>
15:42:16.944490 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;What.&quot;</span>
15:42:25.691252 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Yay gold sink!&quot;</span>
15:42:26.238386 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Everytime I've tried to get it via language tokens since it's been a big fat no.&quot;</span>
15:42:32.208928 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Tahquil is going to be broke again.&quot;</span>
15:42:43.304130 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;BEEEEEEAAAACCCCCHHHHHHH.&quot;</span>
15:42:43.677436 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But yes I'm in favour of enabling access to these old languages.&quot;</span>
15:42:47.362572 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Lupisentia sticks out her tongue and says in a smooth, confident voice, &quot;Starmourn wetwiring.&quot;</span>
15:42:48.095669 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says to Veldrin with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;How much does language lessons cost for you now?&quot;</span>
15:42:53.594567 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Go hand all your money to Sycaerunax.&quot;</span>
15:42:55.554701 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui sticks out his tongue and says, &quot;Starmourn hacking.&quot;</span>
15:43:18.845151 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says to Icraa, &quot;Thanks to my tokens I'm still only at 2,187,000.&quot;</span>
15:43:23.343483 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The skills question is probably a no overall. If we were to do it, it would be &quot;inspired by&quot; at most I think.&quot;</span>
15:43:34.114965 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Doesn't seem like much of a polyglot if she can't even speak Dragon.&quot;</span>
15:43:41.468433 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;More crafting skills are quite possible though.&quot;</span>
15:43:50.242471 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Oooh.&quot;</span>
15:43:51.956175 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;I just remember being impressed by the influence skill when I did try out Lusternia way back.&quot;</span>
15:43:58.913553 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says something unintelligible.</span>
15:44:04.126547 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;There are already a lot of pseudo-influencing systems in the game too.&quot;</span>
15:44:05.955186 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says in Karthic, &quot;Cheating.&quot;</span>
15:44:16.901263 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But they tend to be faction specific and not broadly applicable. Hashan's rumour system for example.&quot;</span>
15:44:22.224547 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Or Ashtan's redacted.&quot;</span>
15:44:42.397072 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Kshavatra is next!&quot;</span>
15:44:48.485910 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</span>
15:44:51.379420 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Kshavatra says, &quot;One aspect that used to be a big part of Achaea that has waned in modern times is cross-factional organizations. Guilds, neutral gods, high clans, etc. I know the guild system had its own share of problems so I'm not asking for a return to that per se, but in modern Achaea most cooperation and conflict is almost always along city lines. It would be nice if there were additional axes around which people could interact and branch out of their 'organizational bubbles' so to speak. That wasn't actually a question, so what are your thoughts on the preceding statement?&quot;</span>
15:45:00.387567 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Kshavatra says, &quot;And also I have to leave now so I will catch the answer on discord.&quot;</span>
15:45:08.860629 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Kshavatra says, &quot;Thank you for your time.&quot;</span>
15:45:09.258046 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Ksha, discord warrior to the end.&quot;</span>
15:45:38.836093 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;And left.&quot;</span>
15:45:48.969174 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Back to his ship, like he never existed.&quot;</span>
15:45:55.845175 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zephyl says with a Baarian accent, &quot;It'd be funny if we just skipped his answer.&quot;</span>
15:45:55.945555 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;I would just answer with orgrelations.&quot;</span>
15:45:59.126233 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says wryly in a quiet voice, &quot;Who?&quot;</span>
15:46:06.059892 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Talking something like the ivory/quis annwyn event, maybe.&quot;</span>
15:46:33.554453 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I like the idea of it in theory. In modern years the factionalisation has made it hard. Guardians of Moghedu exists here. The Knights Guild was meant to (and does to an extent) alleviate that. The Magic Org plan was also intended to help combat that. I personally like temporary alliances and the awkward rp side-eyeing that takes place. The most fertile ground for this is in events I think - the Marks event is a good example of something I think was quite successful, though I wasn't actually here as an admin at the time.&quot;</span>
15:47:06.726640 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;So if it makes sense to do it we will.&quot;</span>
15:47:13.442941 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Tahquil is up next.&quot;</span>
15:47:23.068153 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;I ran out of serious so let's have an easy one. What type of tea is your favourite and what is your preferred side-nibble to that tea? -- Also props to Scarlatti for finding stuff the playerbase is doing and finding ways to interact and up the experiences. Thought I'd add that on.&quot;</span>
15:47:48.121610 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;Coffee. No sugar, no milk. One button.&quot;</span>
15:47:49.773477 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;Simple.&quot;</span>

15:48:02.799385 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;Is it a big red button?&quot;</span>
15:48:07.304502 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;Sometimes.&quot;</span>
15:48:09.836855 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;What is a button.&quot;</span>
15:48:14.676122 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I usually just drink breakfast tea but I'm a sucker for plain digestive biscuits.&quot;</span>
15:48:16.645371 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And hobnobs...&quot;</span>

15:48:26.577508 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ulvin says to Tahquil in a quivering voice, &quot;Maybe a single coffee bean.&quot;</span>
15:48:28.552004 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Hobnobs.&quot;</span>

15:48:32.696445 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Pharaus says in a commanding, deep voice, &quot;When will makarios approved earmuffs become available at the artefact shop?&quot;</span>
15:48:34.349171 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Alyzar in a low, rough voice, &quot;Hear that, you're a hobnob.&quot;</span>
15:48:37.223207 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Pharaus says in a commanding, deep voice, &quot;Hehe.&quot;</span>
15:48:38.686410 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says to Ante in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;No you.&quot;</span>
15:48:39.248849 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Best biscuit ever.&quot;</span>
15:48:45.551611 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa smiles impishly and says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;My tea is Boba.&quot;</span>
15:48:52.829694 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;I'm still waiting for pockets.&quot;</span>
15:48:57.498826 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Where do you stand on the displacement of the Americano in favour of the Long Black...&quot;</span>
15:49:01.468732 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;That was a whole lot of english response there.&quot;</span>
15:49:15.526804 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But coffee is black with sugar.&quot;</span>
15:49:24.483761 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Yilui is up next!&quot;</span>
15:49:49.392518 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Yilui laughingly says, &quot;Oh. I think Nezaya asked my question about the House rework earlier so you can skip me. Sorry!&quot;</span>
15:49:57.138968 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Myrddin then in that case!&quot;</span>
15:50:12.777472 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Gotchu, buddy.&quot;</span>
15:50:26.319102 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;City coffer outlooks are strained, credit prices remain unstable, and the cost of city improvements is at an all time high. While some cities may flourish, others inevitably struggle due to factors such as fluctuating player activity, declining interest in mining, and an oversaturation of the common &quot;Well, we offer renown&quot; justification.&quot;</span>
15:50:37.992952 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;However, the core issue is the drastic decline in commodity availability, the instability of the credit market, and the ever growing financial burden placed on cities. Would you and your team consider having a different resource be made available to cities that coincide with commodities to lessen the burden of just dropping 14 million gold a month bare minimum improvement costs? Perhaps renown for CITY RENOWN quests / city hunts which would act like forays, or something along the lines of CITY SPIRIT INVEST MAINTAIN EVERYTHING (but not spirit power or conquest gated). Basically to fill the gap of credit purchases that also allocate credits to the city/houses.&quot;</span>
15:50:51.509234 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Also if you still want to get in the queue, you have a few minutes left before I start to wind down as we still have 12 left to go in the queue.&quot;</span>
15:50:59.553214 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;City coffers? -perk-.&quot;</span>
15:51:15.548364 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says to Myrddin, &quot;I still think having areas you've conquested offer comms to cities as 'tax' would be an idea.&quot;</span>
15:51:22.686806 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin says, &quot;Ooh, I like the idea of renown adventures that give renown to the city.&quot;</span>
15:51:32.124804 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Myrddin in a guttural voice, &quot;Platinum solves everything.&quot;</span>
15:51:41.117490 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;How get in queue?&quot;</span>
15:51:42.697617 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;But they are addressing mining concerns on the forums.&quot;</span>
15:51:46.596311 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Send me a tell to join the queue.&quot;</span>
15:51:54.650464 # <span style="color:aqua;">(Market): Ithilien says, &quot;Buying golddragontooth.&quot;</span>
15:52:01.145875 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Proficy in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;They are, but is was more of a &quot;what more can we do other than mining&quot;.&quot;</span>
15:52:46.537347 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Alchemist transmuting of commodities... like they do with minerals perhaps?&quot;</span>
15:53:13.199646 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I think as a first step we'll take a look at the outgoings and do an audit to get a sense of how sane the numbers are here. I know there's a lot of pain points, so I'm not really ready to commit to anything specific here as a fix yet.&quot;</span>
15:53:15.867206 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ulvin says in a quivering voice, &quot;Hm, maybe we could have denizen villages selling their own commodities.&quot;</span>
15:53:32.244285 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;We did that, but it made its own problems.&quot;</span>
15:53:33.254420 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;Like lacquer.&quot;</span>
15:53:39.615353 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Myrddin in a guttural voice, &quot;City improvements are easy to maintain with city involvement.... or... they are not... you dont NEED to have them.&quot;</span>
15:53:41.279167 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Lacquer is a leftover, yeah.&quot;</span>
15:53:58.283949 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;City org renown is probably not on the cards, but mining is definitely a big focus.&quot;</span>
15:54:04.512578 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says to Proficy, &quot;Says the squat little monoploy man.&quot;</span>
15:54:11.366345 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;What I'm hearing is you're going to be bringing in some folks from PwC to take a look at Myrddin's books?&quot;</span>
15:54:18.913525 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Tahquil in a guttural voice, &quot;My personal supply is NOT mhaldors supply.&quot;</span>
15:54:19.733182 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I know that's not a very detailed answer, but it's a complex question so I'd rather get my info accurate before going any further.&quot;</span>
15:54:27.270103 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And Prof is never getting rid of that platinum.&quot;</span>
15:54:30.595241 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Tahquil in a guttural voice, &quot;Targ is more then capable of buying me out, if they can afford the pricetag.&quot;</span>
15:54:30.895648 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;He tried to build a road with it.&quot;</span>

15:54:42.176476 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Ictinus in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Of course, I just wanted a discussion on the table for you to look at.&quot;</span>
15:54:45.919685 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi frowns and says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;None of us are getting rid of our platinum.&quot;</span>
15:54:47.681965 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Axios is up!&quot;</span>
15:54:52.436250 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;Conflict is seen as a good thing, and is often promoted by the Garden directly in PK-related events, but especially when it is intense and high stakes it can also lead to bad blood between factions OOCly. I wonder if you have any views on balancing between making players care about winning which engenders a higher level of competition but also cultivating a playerbase that (mostly) likes each other. There's obviously a role for players to play there but I wonder if you have views from the Garden based on where we are at currently as a playerbase that you will share? I'm mostly talking about the faction vs faction vibes, not individuals. Thank you and good luck with everything, off to a great start.&quot;</span>
15:55:03.540872 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;I just got rid of my platinum.&quot;</span>

15:55:18.022192 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;That was like 5k worth of gold.&quot;</span>
15:55:19.706345 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ulvin says in a quivering voice, &quot;Odd habits.&quot;</span>

15:56:38.457887 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I think it's pretty obvious that some of that is due to blunders in the past, some of which can be directly attributed to my oversights or mistakes.&quot;</span>
15:57:02.148347 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Badriyah says with a velvety, playful Hashani accent, &quot;I've always found it odd that there's just no way of breaching the bad blood bet ween like every single organization with every other one.&quot;</span>
15:58:19.225668 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;I think a lot of people dislike my character, and until they talk to me outside of the game they don't realize I am just as awful.&quot;</span>
15:58:40.322790 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Obviously I'd like to avoid those blunders going forward as I think they're a large contributing factor to intensifying already existing feelings of bad blood in heated conflict situations.&quot;</span>

15:59:48.254166 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow laughingly says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;I thought you meant one more charge tank ready to go.&quot;</span>
15:59:59.581857 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;I know its affecting some now.&quot;</span>
16:00:08.625335 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But it's also a two way street. As much as we have to foster a healthy combat environment, we have to all remember that there are players on the other side of the screen from you who are just as invested as you are.&quot;</span>
16:00:14.214558 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;I think it is attributed to people just thinking that IG characters are strongly based on our OOC persona, which may be true in some instances but people would be amazed if they pushed aside the IG persona.&quot;</span>
16:00:21.452078 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Yes, what Ictinus said.&quot;</span>
16:00:43.042493 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Except, of course, Aranos.&quot;</span>
16:00:47.480180 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;I tried to reach out to the players on opposing teams oocly before any big decisions, and it helped somewhat... sometimes...&quot;</span>
16:00:51.322258 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says something unintelligible.</span>
16:00:52.902568 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Myrddin, &quot;I did gasp, you just can't see it.&quot;</span>
16:00:59.787544 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;Also has to be said that bad blood can happen within factions as well, and that can be the most toxic at times.&quot;</span>
16:01:25.788920 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I tend to think that what happens IC should generally stay IC and that people should err on the side of someone's in game actions being a character driven decision. This is a bit idealistic but I also tend to think that idle hands make the devil's work as the saying goes.&quot;</span>
16:01:31.410334 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Maybe for you. Gaia surgically removes our feelings and we're all one big happy spore network now.&quot;</span>
16:01:35.280129 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;I'm a delight. Offering Mediation services.&quot;</span>
16:01:42.306495 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;As someone who has struggled with this for years, I just wanna say too that some people ARE close to their characters, and very emotionally invested. When I did some RP in non-mud environments, we'd often have a Safeword for when RP gets too intense or if someone's &quot;being the bad guy&quot; is too much for a person.&quot;</span>
16:01:46.282001 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And so I lean towards thinking that as the game gears up for more activity, this is a problem that sort of naturally solves itself as everyone gets to feel that they have a piece of the pie.&quot;</span>
16:01:47.114416 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says to Myrddin in a calm voice, &quot;Unfortunately I like you in the game and outside of it.&quot;</span>
16:01:51.619007 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orphian says to Treyal in a calm and measured voice, &quot;One of us.&quot;</span>
16:01:52.457893 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;I wonder if it's tied to the earlier question of having more cross-factional orgs to put people in contact ICly otherwise in RP capacities. I don't expect a fully fleshed answer of course, it's big and imprecise and messy, but I do think it's important for systems to support some kind of friendly interactions.&quot;</span>
16:02:10.577302 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Gaelyn in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Yes, it is truly the worst.&quot;</span>
16:02:15.125885 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Sorry this is a bit meandering but hopefully my intent is coming off correctly here. The tldr is that more activity is more conflict and more engagement and that tends to override a lot of bad feelings since a loss becomes a bit more ephemeral as you're onto the next thing sooner.&quot;</span>
16:02:20.079470 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;Recusants was an attempt at that to an extent, which died on the vine for better or worse.&quot;</span>
16:02:38.090701 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;I do think the point about the next event coming up soon after makes sense. Thank you for the consideration.&quot;</span>
16:02:40.704857 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Simply solve world peace, Icti. But like, in a fun and compelling way that enables conflict.&quot;</span>
16:02:41.750472 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Gosh.&quot;</span>
16:02:44.629911 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Ok, but there's a difference between IC conflict and some of the gross bullshit people get away with shouting.&quot;</span>
16:02:46.985915 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;Some people value their xp way too much and should learn to consider death as mandatory break time, we all need to take more breaks from the screen ANYWAYS.&quot;</span>
16:02:51.243799 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;We can probably sacrifice Alyzar for world peace.&quot;</span>
16:02:56.404484 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Agreed.&quot;</span>
16:02:57.963543 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;No conquest, just world cup football.&quot;</span>
16:02:58.776538 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Agreed.&quot;</span>
16:02:59.570779 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;The feeling has on some level become &quot;are there actually language rules?&quot;&quot;</span>
16:03:05.097127 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Icraa takes a lot of breaks.&quot;</span>
16:03:05.732795 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And Zorina is next!&quot;</span>
16:03:06.677376 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;For some.&quot;</span>
16:03:07.445306 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal frowns and says, &quot;Aly's the only one here I would miss.&quot;</span>
16:03:09.070486 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zorina says with a faint accent, &quot;First, echoing all the appreciation: So much has been done already to improve and listen to players. It's really heartening and I'm super excited for the future. I was asked to ask this question and this was kind of touched on already, but more specifically - is there any research being done to find out what similar games, MMO or otherwise, are doing to increase the playerbase/purchase rate level or are you just kind of winging it and hoping for the best? And then secondly, are there plans to take some of the QOL artefacts, like the gold attractor, and make them into skills?&quot;</span>
16:03:19.238670 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;I agree with that. Some of the things being shouted sometimes are utterly awful.&quot;</span>
16:03:24.421200 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Okay, I am closing the queue in 1 minute.&quot;</span>
16:03:37.253174 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Mind the gap!&quot;</span>
16:04:17.994108 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says to Treyal in a calm voice, &quot;You'd miss me. Don't lie.&quot;</span>
16:04:25.274120 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says to Gaelyn in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;We'd miss you.&quot;</span>
16:04:26.507836 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Huh. Queue is just &quot;Q&quot; being said with all the other letters waiting their turn,.&quot;</span>
16:04:33.240200 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;So, I don't think we can feasibly turn artefacts back into skills for a variety of reasons. But what we can do is keep adding things to the game in that regard that aren't paid items, which I think eventually kind of balances itself out. The last few days of updates are really just the beginning.&quot;</span>
16:05:16.579089 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zorina says with a faint accent, &quot;Makes sense.&quot;</span>
16:05:25.321836 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Which isn't to say we aren't going to add new paid items since we are somewhat forced to as part of the game's continued existence. But I'm pretty confident in our ability to make a lot of QoL additions that aren't restricted in that way.&quot;</span>
16:05:40.722951 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;As for new players: I've got some thoughts, but it's hard in 2025 to get brand new players short of something external that injects them into the game.&quot;</span>
16:05:41.516400 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;My wallet stands ready.&quot;</span>
16:05:51.035071 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Such as an interview on a high profile website or something like that.&quot;</span>
16:05:54.580761 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui sticks out his tongue and says, &quot;Put Nexus on Steam.&quot;</span>
16:05:55.448701 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Treyal's wallet is already in tears.&quot;</span>
16:05:58.913495 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Draknathor says, &quot;I got injected into the game.&quot;</span>
16:05:59.605230 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zephyl says with a Baarian accent, &quot;Get rid of all paid content, and log the hours as volunteer work.&quot;</span>
16:06:02.354870 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Nonsense he can pick up another few castles.&quot;</span>
16:06:03.087098 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Nexus on steam is planned, tetnatively.&quot;</span>
16:06:03.711256 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;Worked for CDDA.&quot;</span>
16:06:12.017690 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;A comic perhaps, of some stuff that happens in game.&quot;</span>
16:06:13.144119 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zorina says with a faint accent, &quot;Awesome, that's cool. Thanks!&quot;</span>
16:06:15.353047 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;I don't think so. You're getting new players. I was new to muds in 2021, and there are people who still discover Achaea in an organic way in 2025.&quot;</span>
16:06:17.104669 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says to Nezaya in a calm voice, &quot;Some say its bottomless.&quot;</span>
16:06:20.077546 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;Highway billboards.&quot;</span>
16:06:22.756703 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Agramon says in a calm, slow voice, &quot;Speaking of, did you guys see the article on pcgamer a few days ago? They shouted out IRE games.&quot;</span>
16:06:22.871264 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;On, Nexus on steam, that is cool.&quot;</span>
16:06:29.384054 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Mostly word of mouth I imagine.&quot;</span>
16:06:52.080565 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;As I kind of mentioned earlier too, Achaea's website is pretty bad and out of date at this point.&quot;</span>
16:07:02.405083 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;A big overhaul is unlikely but a freshen up is on the cards which will help here to whatever degree.&quot;</span>
16:07:06.123613 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:lime;">Erikarn</span><span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;"> is next!&quot;</span>
16:07:07.699497 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Rekhyr says in a warm, gravelly voice, &quot;And the wiki.&quot;</span>
16:08:09.082401 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Halos is actually doing a wonderful job on the Wiki. A lot of people are, but Halos is there making changes everyday I think.&quot;</span>
16:08:10.306799 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;Don't you use tintin?&quot;</span>
16:08:17.707592 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Tinyfugue, Orinna.&quot;</span>
16:08:19.124434 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Get it right.&quot;</span>
16:08:35.524307 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Tintin's for filthy casuals.&quot;</span>
16:08:39.548823 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;First let me say I was expecting a sandwich related question. My disappointment is immeasurable.&quot;</span>
16:08:40.340351 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Orinna says in a melodic voice, &quot;It begins with 'Tin'! I was close enough.&quot;</span>
16:08:44.884137 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Right?&quot;</span>
16:08:45.251486 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Hah.&quot;</span>
16:08:48.921949 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to you in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Failure.&quot;</span>
16:08:55.614312 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;There we go.&quot;</span>
16:08:59.553581 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;The pun made up for it.&quot;</span>
16:09:00.344899 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:lime;">Erikarn</span><span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;"> is an expert on sandwiches. A sandwich artist, if you will.&quot;</span>
16:09:01.799372 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Cut the mustard and answer the question!&quot;</span>
16:09:06.327561 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;He does not need to ask you anything on that topic.&quot;</span>
16:09:23.009863 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says to Nezaya in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Sand-witchcraft, you mean.&quot;</span>
16:09:24.312039 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Claes looks thoughtful and says in a steady, measured voice, &quot;I have to go, can I send my question for when my name comes up?&quot;</span>
16:09:41.419494 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But background image/audio stuff is IRE level stuff usually since it requires a lot of access we don't strictly have.&quot;</span>
16:09:44.800405 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says to Alyzar in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;That's the Rye of it.&quot;</span>
16:09:47.137009 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I know Matt is a big fan of sound stuff.&quot;</span>
16:10:04.161300 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Ah, don't be so sourdough.&quot;</span>
16:10:10.433586 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;For other client-qol things, we still have the old submissions from a poll that we're looking into to see what can be made game side instead of requiring client code to do it.&quot;</span>
16:10:19.772418 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Alyzar in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Legacy has a soundtrack that changes on the area / place you are in!&quot;</span>
16:10:39.632385 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Myrddin, &quot;Yes but that system is trash.&quot;</span>
16:10:44.010543 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says in a calm voice, &quot;I keep forgetting to try it.&quot;</span>
16:10:48.891000 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Zephyl is up next!&quot;</span>
16:10:54.055007 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zephyl says with a Baarian accent, &quot;Achaea's oceans are vast and it seems like there is room for a lot of roleplay and mechanical features. However, it seems like once you're on the ocean, you can only sail, hunt sea monsters, fish, or dive. All of which require a ship. Plus, as far as I'm aware, there are very few areas that are located in an underwater ocean setting, such as Riparium or Isaiah, but even they seem inconsequential once you reach a certain level. Do you have any plans to expand upon sea exploration or even underwater ocean exploration in the future? To diversify further from Icraa's previous question, I'm speaking in a strict 'ship-not-required' sense. Furthermore, are there any plans for races with oceanic origins, such as merfolk? I, for one, would love to be able to incorporate more oceanic-themed roleplaying other than 'I was born on an island'.&quot;</span>
16:11:09.099354 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Claes says in a steady, measured voice, &quot;Thanks for the Townhall!&quot;</span>
16:11:49.494372 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I don't have specific plans for new races currently but the option is always available if the story makes sense to include it. I would love to do more deep sea / underwater areas that don't strictly require ships though.&quot;</span>
16:12:26.075896 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Underwater, cavernous dungeons to explore beneath the very oceans...&quot;</span>
16:12:30.994719 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;I'd prefer sub sandwiches.&quot;</span>
16:12:32.338904 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zephyl says with a Baarian accent, &quot;Great. Thank you. Sometimes, I want to throw myself into the ocean.&quot;</span>
16:12:32.565153 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;An underwater foray might be fun.&quot;</span>
16:12:36.428557 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Achaea Eurotunnel.&quot;</span>
16:12:37.385378 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;I liked the website soundtrack.&quot;</span>
16:12:46.674751 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;Aranos is frothing.&quot;</span>
16:12:46.854150 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Sounds like someone is trying to sell some fishscale tunics.&quot;</span>

16:12:49.088964 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Scyros for sure.&quot;</span>
16:12:50.463149 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Ok, I'm in.&quot;</span>
16:13:01.607776 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Let's see. Austere is next I think.&quot;</span>
16:13:06.264153 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;Trying to find that foray on the sea map ...&quot;</span>
16:13:06.687690 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Austere says, &quot;Are there any plans in the future to address the large quantity of talismans generated through in game methods and refining? As an example, I have hundreds of talisman mounts that generally are not sought after, and aside from walking around with an absolute unit of an entourage of mounts, I don't really have a good purpose for them. Unweaving has always been an option, but the returns on it are quite laughable, and any buffs to it would further kill the credit market. I understand the difficulty valuing pieces like this over time, but some of these sets are still featured as promotional choices, and it's an awkward situation to have values presented from the administration that don't translate into the actual game.&quot;</span>
16:13:06.836068 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Those poor people with thalassophobia.&quot;</span>
16:13:18.188562 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Austere says, &quot;I'm aware that I am part of the problem. Sorry.&quot;</span>
16:13:19.017592 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Fear is good in RP.&quot;</span>
16:13:23.793691 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Makarios, &quot;Black flares need a better use.&quot;</span>
16:13:32.094434 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa smiles impishly and says to Entaro in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;THANK YOU.&quot;</span>
16:13:37.767312 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says to Aranos with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;Agreed.&quot;</span>
16:14:04.451598 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Austere in a guttural voice, &quot;Refine bashing pieces.&quot;</span>
16:14:06.045597 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says to Austere in a quiet voice, &quot;We need an RP event where you have to do something with crypt worm corpses, clearly.&quot;</span>
16:14:16.860627 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Or maybe just stop farming them.&quot;</span>
16:14:19.890723 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Austere says to Proficy, &quot;It would take me RL years to refine all the ones I have.&quot;</span>
16:14:26.607503 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;And should be easier to acquire, now its like i have to do a whole trade to find out that there are 2 hot single ships in my nearby area? what a waste of time.&quot;</span>
16:14:30.184507 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;We haven't talked about it but I'll add it to the list and see if we can come up with a sane way of doing something with them that's worthwhile.&quot;</span>
16:14:33.329166 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Austere in a guttural voice, &quot;Name and shame... i bet i have more.&quot;</span>
16:14:49.067713 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;AUSTERE TRADEIN CONFIRM.&quot;</span>
16:14:55.111747 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Austere says to Proficy, &quot;12k azatlan pieces.&quot;</span>
16:14:59.506294 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;That's a bit of a short answer but it'll need some thought since I don't think any of us have a practical idea immediately coming to mind.&quot;</span>
16:15:00.508633 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zephyl says with a Baarian accent, &quot;Donate them. Let no Achaean go mountless.&quot;</span>
16:15:01.192564 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Tradein austere confirm?&quot;</span>
16:15:04.385501 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says to Austere in a calm voice, &quot;Ew.&quot;</span>
16:15:04.805977 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Let them just build a super mega cryptworm with every completion.&quot;</span>
16:15:18.965801 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;One extra set of legs for each one.&quot;</span>
16:15:23.312035 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Monkey paw activated. The pieces now decay.&quot;</span>
16:15:28.098273 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Austere in a guttural voice, &quot;Sell me some atlatl's.&quot;</span>
16:15:31.335631 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Like the Magi golem but you're building a worm with talisman pieces.&quot;</span>
16:15:35.129058 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Argwin says, &quot;Put a coupon in all novice packs to contact Austere for a free mount.&quot;</span>
16:15:44.680068 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Xarthus says, &quot;I was given one as a novice, didn't realize how common they were.&quot;</span>
16:15:50.011194 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Austere quests.&quot;</span>
16:15:50.671386 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Crypt worms we can probably do something specific with. TBD.&quot;</span>
16:15:56.596593 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Khadafi, you're up.&quot;</span>
16:16:13.158258 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tureel says in a firm, commanding voice, &quot;All the food gone?&quot;</span>
16:16:16.947202 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Ask Ulvin.&quot;</span>
16:16:18.487368 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Ulvin.&quot;</span>

16:16:29.857917 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Maybe if you drop some platinum he'll spit it back out.&quot;</span>
16:16:33.091343 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;We lost Khadafi it seems. Archaosa!&quot;</span>
16:16:39.446642 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;Back in the dark ages, I remember Great Hunts. I loved these, and often looked forward to them, blocking out a full weekend! I was a little disappointed to see that they don't really happen now. Might that change?&quot;</span>
16:16:43.926672 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;I mean, will they come back?&quot;</span>
16:16:44.653365 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;It was probably about having pool boys spawn faster.&quot;</span>
16:16:52.201738 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa sticks out her tongue and says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;To aaron's you're not wrong.&quot;</span>
16:17:03.010046 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Archaosa, &quot;He left, just me here.&quot;</span>
16:17:03.135952 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;Aaron.&quot;</span>

16:17:12.813274 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Menetta says in a modulated, velvet voice, &quot;Aye Aye Ron.&quot;</span>
16:17:26.965534 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says to Aranos in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;We're talking to Aaron not you.&quot;</span>
16:17:38.151944 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Yes to great hunts. And while I'm here I'll also leak that we're going to look at adding back in the option to set special crit, xp, mob respawn, etc days of the week bonuses for birthday months and events and such.&quot;</span>
16:17:38.694809 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says softly, &quot;Omg. Cmossioning World games would be a sick gold sink.&quot;</span>
16:17:49.900570 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;WOOOOO.&quot;</span>

16:18:09.049559 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Nezaya next!&quot;</span>
16:18:24.570583 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;This isn't my question but you asked me to remind you about language rules. Floor is yours, Icti.&quot;</span>
16:18:29.916092 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;We can maybe do commissioning world games.&quot;</span>
16:18:31.965768 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Maybe I can get to dragon sooner than I thought.&quot;</span>
16:18:49.226943 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Ah yes. I just wanted to touch on it quickly.&quot;</span>
16:19:23.532698 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Mostly as a reminder that HELP LANGUAGE RULES exists. We've seen some close skirting to the line here, especially in shouts. And while I famously love shouting, I would like to just remind everyone that sometimes, less is more and maybe your comment isn't as funny as you think it is.&quot;</span>
16:19:49.923229 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;I am in this picture and I don't like it. Delete.&quot;</span>
16:19:53.667304 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And really, we can do better than falling back on calling someone a whore every single time.&quot;</span>
16:19:56.506830 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Let's do better there.&quot;</span>
16:20:03.111604 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zorina says with a faint accent, &quot;Thank you for saying that.&quot;</span>
16:20:04.822516 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Yeah, you can call them an Alyzar.&quot;</span>
16:20:05.243563 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Absolutely.&quot;</span>

16:20:10.997166 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;If you aren't funny don't post.&quot;</span>
16:20:15.838435 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Ilsefi is up.&quot;</span>
16:20:18.704815 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Austere says, &quot;Does this mean &quot;artie whore&quot; is a canceled insult?&quot;</span>
16:20:20.265192 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Aetolia has an amazing system where player architects get to contribute meaningfully to the game and are paid generously for their time and effort in credits and possibly experience, not just with renown. Are there any plans to do this in Achaea? I would love to write areas, denizens, quests, and so much more for the game.&quot;</span>
16:20:21.328719 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Wasn't my question.&quot;</span>
16:20:24.046540 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Nerd.&quot;</span>
16:20:33.722388 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Menetta says in a modulated, velvet voice, &quot;Mostly when people fall back on thinking sexual activity is a bad thing, it implies they never get any.&quot;</span>
16:20:34.187693 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa smiles impishly and says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;What about a miserable dino-dong?&quot;</span>
16:20:50.512576 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says to Archaosa in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Their dong is a dinosaur, almost a compliment.&quot;</span>
16:20:54.707001 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Xarthus says, &quot;Acceptable.&quot;</span>
16:21:00.709075 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;Go back to Shakespeare, get some proper insults.&quot;</span>
16:21:09.053618 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Mortal builders in Achaea have made some of the biggest contributions to the game across its whole history.&quot;</span>
16:21:11.234560 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says to Austere with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;I believe whale is the acceptable term.&quot;</span>
16:21:11.442897 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Dino dong, fossil, rock hard?&quot;</span>
16:21:14.095095 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sprucebruce says, &quot;Can we reserve the title of Architects for Architects..&quot;</span>

16:21:29.430940 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Ilsefi in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;I would love to do this as well.&quot;</span>
16:21:29.906218 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Laras says with a Shallamese accent, &quot;There used to be mortal builders, but i havent seen calls for that in ages (maybe i missed it).&quot;</span>
16:21:34.999317 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I couldn't have built Yggdrasil or the Underworld without them. But there isn't necessarily an up and coming slew of content for them to work on at present.&quot;</span>
16:21:40.153086 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;I'll stick with Sullen Sacabambaspis then.&quot;</span>
16:22:01.698076 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Last call was in 2019 I believe.&quot;</span>
16:22:08.986355 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says to you in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;And i'll bite my thumb at you.&quot;</span>
16:22:11.460508 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Laras says with a Shallamese accent, &quot;Ah, then i didnt miss it.&quot;</span>
16:22:30.096542 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;I'll skip my question because we got people to go and I got one, but I'll drop a comment with no pushback like a champ: I think if you are interested in reducing bad blood and toxicity, the nature of some of those shouts is where you start. I do not have bad blood with green and I've fought them objectively longer. The bad blood comes from other things and persistence. I see the tells some of these people exchange too and frankly I see Issues that come up and go 'just put them on Ignore.' I think on some level if we want to not be a toxic pit of a community, the expectation can't be 'Nyah nyah, this is basically 4Chan but you have the Ignore feature so its fine.'&quot;</span>
16:22:40.490415 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.&quot;</span>

16:22:51.987028 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;So if the opportunity does come up, we'll consider it definitely.&quot;</span>
16:23:07.546019 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Or you can just SHOUTSOFF and improve your mental health.&quot;</span>
16:23:13.060479 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;The problem with new islands etc is sprawl to an extent. Otherwise I feel like Meropis would have more on it.&quot;</span>
16:23:19.808284 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says to Nezaya, &quot;Tedx at best. How's that as an insult!?&quot;</span>
16:23:21.832278 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Gallus in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;The beset defense in the game.&quot;</span>

16:23:35.766964 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Shouts should just be good content and not low effort redundancies.&quot;</span>
16:23:38.255777 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;Just don't participate is a cop out to lack of moderation.&quot;</span>
16:23:48.278812 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Sure makes me feel better. Sticks and stones.&quot;</span>
16:23:57.740498 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Or just accept that toxicity is what you get for engaging this product.&quot;</span>
16:24:12.584820 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says to Nezaya, &quot;I mean, y'all do spend a lot of time inhaling lead.&quot;</span>
16:24:15.048822 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;It's how I've looked at it for 20 plus years.&quot;</span>
16:24:21.664043 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Claes had to leave but asked about fumology and new craft skills. I'm not sure what we will do here but tentatively new crafts are on the table.&quot;</span>
16:24:22.408366 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sprucebruce says, &quot;Turning blind eyes, and the bystander effect still doesn't make things acceptable.&quot;</span>
16:24:37.258073 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Menetta says in a modulated, velvet voice, &quot;I can be pretty sharp tongued and even I recognize that it's a culture we shouldn't encourage.&quot;</span>
16:24:39.098336 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says to Ictinus with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Yess.&quot;</span>
16:24:46.371556 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Entaro is next.&quot;</span>
16:25:19.417219 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Back in the olden times, Gods were often sparring in shouts and making drama just for the fun of it. The tone shifted quite drastically: - with the new direction were going, is there scope to lessen the seriousness of things?&quot;</span>
16:25:36.177693 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;It felt like at times we had to be super consistent with history and acting like a God than just having fun as players.&quot;</span>
16:25:49.082056 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I don't know about lessening the seriousness necessarily but I think more catfights in shouts between Gods tend to be good on the whole.&quot;</span>
16:26:01.799878 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bellona says in a soothing, aureate voice, &quot;Um i want more seriousness, i feel like i am just here most days.&quot;</span>
16:26:14.854802 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;One of my old favourite memories was Sartan walking down Zanzibaar street with the guards being all 'what are we supposed to do against THAT?' and Mithraea coming down and telling him to scram.&quot;</span>
16:26:20.484558 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bellona says in a soothing, aureate voice, &quot;Just saying.&quot;</span>
16:26:22.891048 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Hashan and Mhaldor were at each other's throats for months once because of a catfight between Twi and Sartan..&quot;</span>
16:26:23.416369 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says to Veldrin in a laboured voice, &quot;Things like that, yes.&quot;</span>
16:26:24.920465 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;More general God interactions would be a solid plus for most of the player base. You use to be able to walk across Gods simply being..yes, like Veldrin said.&quot;</span>
16:26:35.665370 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Menetta says in a modulated, velvet voice, &quot;There is some difficulty in divining that fine line between roleplaying an asshole and just kind of ..being an asshole.&quot;</span>
16:26:38.410965 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Jimothy serving Gaia kawhe, Targossas, circa 2025 (Modernized).&quot;</span>
16:26:43.847748 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'd file that under what I said earlier about increasing the atmosphere of the game I think. I want to do a lot here and God visibility and front facing action is high on the list.&quot;</span>
16:26:50.839161 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says to Ante in a calm voice, &quot;Aodfionn almost fainted.&quot;</span>
16:26:54.938002 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Awesome, thanks.&quot;</span>
16:27:08.169556 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Gaelyn in a low, rough voice, &quot;Yeah it was definitely a &quot;oh fk i was talking shit&quot;.&quot;</span>
16:27:19.235467 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naxx says, &quot;Thank you for the meeting.&quot;</span>
16:27:26.199624 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Agramon says in a calm, slow voice, &quot;More Gods that aren't faction locked would add a lot, I feel.&quot;</span>
16:27:34.837477 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;Agreed.&quot;</span>
16:27:35.209313 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Well, if Haskor passes his trials...&quot;</span>
16:27:35.466405 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;I think Pandora is a good example of a nice balance. Endorse her or what the new term is, forgotten already.&quot;</span>
16:27:48.194816 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sprucebruce says, &quot;He wont, we need to enslave him..&quot;</span>
16:27:49.049023 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;Esteem.&quot;</span>
16:27:52.507709 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;Esteem her yes.&quot;</span>
16:27:55.460729 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Ante, &quot;I remember Sartan and Pandora getting into a fight and choosing champions at NoNT randomly to settle it.&quot;</span>
16:28:00.173308 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;He's going to make a fine servant of the Bloodsworn.&quot;</span>
16:28:13.317061 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Deuc trial: Enslavement.&quot;</span>
16:28:17.116442 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says to Aranos in a low, rough voice, &quot;Even the ranked RPS with gaia was great.&quot;</span>
16:28:18.898358 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;Ironically, for the person behind Haskor to become a God, Haskor needs to fail at becoming a God.&quot;</span>
16:28:25.653919 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;On talks of atmosphere, sometimes it does feel like I'm not really playing the game, the Gods are and I'm just along for the ride.&quot;</span>
16:28:26.634522 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;Going to laugh when it was just a bored Aegis doing trials for fun.&quot;</span>
16:28:44.629101 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I was asked anonymously if we would consider consolidating houses down from multiples into one per city. This is probably something we need to discuss internally. The longer-term intention was for the Knights, Magic Org, and others to eventually supersede the need for houses to be as monolithic as they are. But I'm not sure right now what we're going to do yet.&quot;</span>
16:28:46.783740 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Pandora kinda forgot that they were in a D role though and was just a pain in the ass with no reward.&quot;</span>
16:29:09.485218 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Ereia is up!&quot;</span>
16:29:20.354240 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia smiles and says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Mine's a double so bear with me.&quot;</span>
16:29:21.643809 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Molli says with a heavy Cyrenian accent, &quot;Aw, but I like my House...&quot;</span>
16:29:26.212402 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;When HELP ADMIN PENALTIES was released, it was a good step towards transparency, however one of the rulings about Hatespeech/Discrimination raised a question amongst a few. The ruling states specifically OOC, but the reality is that people will bring their biases into the game even ICly and that includes instances of bigotry towards the LGBT and misogyny throughout the community that creates a hostile environment in the game and pushes people away from enjoying Achaea. Is the admin team also considering in character instances of these sort of language behaviors equally to OOC?&quot;</span>
16:29:26.784799 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;We need more houses not less.&quot;</span>
16:29:34.989386 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Also.&quot;</span>
16:29:36.033198 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;The renown system is of course useful in getting your 20 credits, but also things such as wheel spins have been integrated into it where someone must choose between getting their 100 credits or get a single chance promotional that, for the most part, does not come close to equating this cost and feels very customer unfriendly. Is there any examination being done towards the renown system to improve this pain point?&quot;</span>
16:29:36.427990 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Laras says with a Shallamese accent, &quot;And i would like to ask on record to not get rid of the houses.&quot;</span>
16:29:37.029491 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal laughingly says, &quot;Absolutely do not need more houses.&quot;</span>
16:29:38.637308 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says to Ictinus in a guttural voice, &quot;May be necessary in some multi theological organizations.&quot;</span>
16:29:49.177849 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Imyrr says to Tahquil in a sublimely tenored voice, &quot;Pandora was her own reward.&quot;</span>
16:30:02.015146 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Synbios says, &quot;Go for the middle: Just the right amount of houses.&quot;</span>
16:30:31.989800 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Too many houses are already single digit player holdings where novices are left basically completely unattended until they get bored and leave or stop playing.&quot;</span>
16:30:32.928044 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says to Treyal, &quot;It doesn't matter if a house just have one member though, these days it's mostly just org credits.&quot;</span>
16:31:29.108053 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Houses are fine. Less city clans detracting from house identities.&quot;</span>
16:31:32.518435 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;Or purge it and conquer it in the name of the Outriders and take the credits themselves, we love to explore new horizons after all.&quot;</span>
16:31:33.983030 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Amen.&quot;</span>
16:31:40.108183 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Lets start absorbing some.&quot;</span>
16:32:33.929495 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;Some houses have 1 main active person doing all the roles...not very fine.&quot;</span>
16:32:48.369404 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;Then train better?&quot;</span>
16:32:50.417218 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Well then.&quot;</span>
16:32:51.939126 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;That's what I do.&quot;</span>
16:32:59.999369 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Kasotus, &quot;Might as well drop them all.&quot;</span>
16:33:01.034734 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says to Milabar, &quot;What house are you leading again?&quot;</span>
16:33:11.633730 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says to Treyal in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;Outriders.&quot;</span>
16:33:19.806799 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;I was in the Outriders for a hundred and fifty years and there was absolutely no guidance.&quot;</span>
16:33:26.236591 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;Things have changed?&quot;</span>
16:33:38.224592 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Next question?&quot;</span>
16:33:43.094028 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sprucebruce says, &quot;Did I miss a response to Ereia?&quot;</span>
16:33:45.601603 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;No.&quot;</span>
16:33:47.297113 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'm writing it.&quot;</span>
16:33:54.685222 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Nod emote.&quot;</span>
16:33:54.836334 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;The Tasks system went a decent way towards self-guided progression for novices.&quot;</span>
16:33:57.681891 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;I think they are writing. It's deserves a well thought out one.&quot;</span>
16:33:58.882030 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Ah, all the side chatter.&quot;</span>
16:34:03.680026 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;I feel like houses tend to feel like they're just subparts of a city without a lot of teeth behind them, since orders tend to cover the theological and city ministry/authority tends to cover the governing body..houses feel a little weirdly spaced from my PoV.&quot;</span>
16:34:04.663560 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Thought it was over.&quot;</span>
16:34:07.323874 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Hush you all.&quot;</span>
16:34:08.479865 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says in a calm voice, &quot;Double questions take longer for answers!&quot;</span>
16:34:22.522912 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;OK, I know this is a sensitive one and I apologise for the wait while I got my thoughts together. Traditionally IC prejudices have always been permitted within reasonable parameters of RP and I don't think it's really practical to eliminate those as options IC since they are legitimate behaviours of characters in the world's setting. Sometimes that can cross a line and that line is very hard to delineate clearly. The most I can say here is that the line will be drawn when the team feels it is necessary to be drawn.&quot;</span>
16:34:29.307379 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;I think it just depends on the House. You couldn't remove Eleusis 'Nature' Houses and replace them with a magic house, for example.&quot;</span>
16:34:34.414652 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Say Glad to hear things have gotten better, I guess according to you, but houses are in a dire place and very few of them have any identity. As kind of hinted by the fact that I didn't even know you were an Outrider.&quot;</span>
16:34:50.050744 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But this is also an area where trust and good will are essential. It's paramount that you know that the systems to redress these mattesr are actually working.&quot;</span>
16:34:52.659802 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Because, 90% of people, myself guilty of it included: don't even mention their house in their titles anymore unless they're a novice.&quot;</span>
16:35:08.529969 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says to Ante, &quot;Extent it's a legacy problem: Guilds had build-in identities which Houses don't.&quot;</span>
16:35:16.354437 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;To that I would say we need to let actions speak for us on this.&quot;</span>
16:35:16.990663 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Zenui says, &quot;To an extent it's a legacy problem: Guilds had build-in identities which Houses don't.&quot;</span>
16:35:30.309344 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;I've got two houses in mine, hahaa.&quot;</span>
16:35:41.648305 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;House conversation over.&quot;</span>
16:35:44.828247 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Hush you all.&quot;</span>
16:35:51.871538 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Can you define what might be an IC prejudice versus a TOS violation?&quot;</span>
16:36:01.362088 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;No.&quot;</span>
16:36:05.787707 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And that is the crux of the issue.&quot;</span>
16:36:08.978714 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Is it considered valid IC prejudice to bully someone who uses the... whatever it is.&quot;</span>
16:36:10.008522 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Bunni says in a cheerful, fae-like voice, &quot;I am confused on why gender, and sex are an avenue for acceptable conflict when we have a thousand more interesting means of it.&quot;</span>
16:36:17.074650 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;The gender change thing.&quot;</span>
16:36:42.443893 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Austere says, &quot;You guys have gender based conflict? I'm playing a different game..&quot;</span>
16:36:53.487994 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Like if someone is racist against Mhun, that's fine. If someone is spitting transphobia or sexism, is that considered IC or is that going too far?&quot;</span>
16:36:56.324600 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Nezaya says in a charmingly wicked voice, &quot;Yes.&quot;</span>
16:36:56.444303 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ilsefi says in a soft, euphonious voice, &quot;Everyone deserves to feel safe in this space.&quot;</span>
16:36:57.112741 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;I've never seen this happen on our side of the continent.&quot;</span>
16:37:07.314667 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Is there a suitable avenue where criticism of someone's sexuality or gender creates a stable and healthy environment?&quot;</span>
16:37:08.713887 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;Something like passing snide remarks would be 'okay' and IC, but a history of repeatedly seeking out a person to remark on them is not?&quot;</span>
16:37:24.864037 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says to Gallus in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;I say it as someone that's been targeted by it in three cities but.&quot;</span>
16:37:29.596558 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;I can't see any gender-based conflict being a good tone for the game.&quot;</span>
16:37:39.400318 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Menetta says in a modulated, velvet voice, &quot;Without naming names, there are a lot of players who have some pretty intense misogynistic behavior ingrained in them to the poin that they might not even notice it..&quot;</span>
16:37:40.593671 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Archaosa says in a cool, quiet voice, &quot;I agree with Axios.&quot;</span>
16:37:40.595718 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Asmodron says in a low voice, &quot;This tea chat is spicy.&quot;</span>
16:37:42.216939 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;Agreed.&quot;</span>
16:37:42.732154 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;I've seen a few, albeit usually few and far between, instances of these kinds of behaviors. It's almost exclusively jarringly bad taste.&quot;</span>
16:37:43.124590 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Blackwillow says with a soft, ethereal Eleusian accent, &quot;It is an IG choice though, not all people who change their gender IC do so because that's their RL preference and such.&quot;</span>
16:37:50.713125 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Xarthus says, &quot;I have not seen any of that in Mhaldor.&quot;</span>

16:39:25.293362 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Kudos to making it two and a half hours without anyone getting mad!&quot;</span>
16:40:03.127921 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ravai says, &quot;I said good tea terminology about the simmering down, but then I regretted commenting but now I am translating.&quot;</span>
16:41:06.612293 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ante says in a low, rough voice, &quot;Excellent simmering everyone.&quot;</span>
16:41:16.104310 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;This is a complex problem without an easy answer though, we need to be real about that. I'm not going to pretend otherwise. I do think there are occasional venues for legitimate RP here, but the bigger overarching concern is that some things are not obviously IC or OOC here. That's why it needs to be a careful line drawn, which is by definition subjective. I need to think on this some more but I'm willing to at least say that we'll revisit the policy and see if we can make the distinction clearer in order to prevent having to come down on managing specific RP topics.&quot;</span>
16:42:16.248822 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;All I can say though is that if you feel someone is going over the line, then issue them and we will handle the situation.&quot;</span>
16:42:42.798063 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;I'm willing to see how it goes then.&quot;</span>
16:42:52.548680 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says to Ictinus in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;My add on question is less sensitive.&quot;</span>
16:42:56.426544 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Historically though I have been extremely harsh on people who are blatantly being awful.&quot;</span>
16:42:58.843024 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sprucebruce says, &quot;I think anonymous issues should be considered for things we feel completely break ToS.&quot;</span>

16:43:20.833047 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Austere says to Sprucebruce, &quot;Just issue yourself for those.&quot;</span>
16:43:58.357816 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The follow-up is easier to answer though yes. We'll be looking at expanding renown options.&quot;</span>
16:44:07.671334 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Naytorlin is next on the list.&quot;</span>
16:44:28.268723 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says to Ictinus with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Are we skipping the second question?&quot;</span>
16:44:34.272083 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Just making sure before I drop mine.&quot;</span>
16:44:35.617308 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I answered it, I think?&quot;</span>
16:44:59.746305 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;The question about spending renwon and stuff on wheel rolls.&quot;</span>
16:45:15.361604 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;He said they're looking to expand it!&quot;</span>
16:45:17.193648 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;I may have missed it.&quot;</span>
16:45:21.386853 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Then i missed it!&quot;</span>
16:45:27.170580 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Expand might be the wrong word there. Review and audit and expand is more accurate I think.&quot;</span>
16:45:55.137120 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;My question pertains around more specifically that activity of more divine. Are there any plans to campaign again for more di</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">vines</span><span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;"> to have their roles filled? I know there were some pushes in the past, even so far as some reddit ads being posted. So with the Haskor event and the announcement before Gaia coming back, I just want to revisit and see if there is going to be any push in that realm still. Also lets my feelings be heard that, want more divine interactions, it's a big part of what drew me to the game 15 years ago, and what brought/kept me back.&quot;</span>
16:46:36.693369 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;I realize that's basically been answered by a handful of other questions, so really just wanted to throw my hat in the ring with the &quot;more di</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">vines</span><span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;"> and interactions please.&quot;&quot;</span>
16:46:43.630210 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Definitely. I've touched on this a few times tonight now. More God activity is on the cards, along with a dramatically increased focus on immersion, rp engagement, and so on.&quot;</span>
16:46:50.724422 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Also a reminder that Celani applications are always open now!&quot;</span>
16:46:53.770406 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Don't need to wait for a call!&quot;</span>
16:47:06.645708 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Imyrr says in a sublimely tenored voice, &quot;But still restricted to the currently looking-for godroles?&quot;</span>
16:47:06.969385 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Follow up to that, we have to wayside our character to be divine right?&quot;</span>
16:47:08.385359 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Entaro says in a laboured voice, &quot;EU bed time.&quot;</span>
16:47:19.910833 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Milabar says in a soft, passionate voice, &quot;To natyo Yes.&quot;</span>
16:47:26.613614 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I'll have a look at the help, Imyrr.&quot;</span>
16:47:29.763361 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Naytorlin says with a short, clipped accent, &quot;Unfortunate, but makes sense.&quot;</span>
16:47:57.778071 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;For coders you'll need to check with Mak.&quot;</span>
16:48:17.499399 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Alyzar next!&quot;</span>
16:48:30.280191 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Makarios, the Meticulous says, &quot;Coder applications are always welcome yes.&quot;</span>
16:49:26.630073 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Treyal says, &quot;Get on it </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:lime;">Erikarn</span><span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">.&quot;</span>
16:49:33.232602 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;It's not something on the cards at the moment. Part of my experience with the stat artefacts for example was that it felt really bad having to leaprog over the level 1 to buy the level 2 immediately for twice the price and no benefit if you had the white amulet.&quot;</span>
16:49:35.655421 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Draknathor says, &quot;Oh I like that idea, anything to help bridge the gap of power between a new character and one who's been around for a decade or two. Outside of a crippling credit card bill.&quot;</span>
16:49:44.223095 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;And I'd like to think on how we'd address that before doing anything in this field.&quot;</span>
16:49:52.618919 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Alyzar says in a smooth, amiable voice, &quot;That's fair.&quot;</span>
16:50:07.284268 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But Mak said earlier and I'm happy to reaffirm that barrier of entry is always a concern too, so we're open to it if we have something to change that we're happy with.&quot;</span>
16:50:12.600874 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sprucebruce says, &quot;Maybe more of a 'buff&quot;.&quot;</span>
16:50:42.883577 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Proficy is up!&quot;</span>
16:50:50.964819 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;This is a very biased and Mhaldor organizational question. But our structure being a very Monarchy type of organization. We have gone, MORE TIMES, than less... without direct authority to act on the organizations best interests. I say this because, i personally have been shot down with taking actions with the best organizational intent, but have been placed aside for whatever circumstances. Moving forward, as this is not a concern with most organizations. Could we work on establishing a mechanism for addressing structural concerns, when needed, While Sartan handles matters whereever else? I ask because of my very specific position and role within the city, combined with unfortunate timing in those moments of need.&quot;</span>
16:51:37.338466 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Dramatic events have gone astray.&quot;</span>
16:51:53.375039 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;If this is based around order induction powers, that one is going to be a hard no.&quot;</span>
16:52:00.505036 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I firmly believe that only Gods should be able to induct people into their order.&quot;</span>
16:52:09.211512 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;Not at all.&quot;</span>
16:52:11.384578 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Icraa says with a faint, Xorani accent, &quot;So the PEGASUS gets to emote... i see how it is.&quot;</span>
16:52:20.551704 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;I waited almost 400 years for order entry... all the other plebs can wait in line.&quot;</span>
16:52:24.792847 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Myrddin says to Icraa in a captivatingly deep voice, &quot;It is a pretty pegasus.&quot;</span>
16:52:35.702521 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;This is about city matters... moving forward.&quot;</span>
16:52:38.101795 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Axios says in a quiet voice, &quot;It only took me 100 years, I must be four times as Evil.&quot;</span>
16:52:41.983746 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;We hold no elections.&quot;</span>
16:52:43.031226 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gaelyn says to Proficy in a calm voice, &quot;I'd laugh at that If I could.&quot;</span>
16:52:51.351164 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;All right, pardon my misunderstanding then in that case. Regarding city governance that requires the God: orgreqs will fill this gap now and if it becomes a problem, you're welcome to message me.&quot;</span>
16:52:59.571237 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;But are held to appointments, based off the judgement of whomeever receives them.&quot;</span>
16:53:01.688277 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I do generally believe that letting these things sit is unhealthy.&quot;</span>
16:53:33.440429 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;And to be fair.... i am by no means at current state, the overarching authority.&quot;</span>
16:53:39.461865 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Sprucebruce says, &quot;Players can induct into the pre-order stuff or is that held for the God as well?&quot;</span>
16:53:48.793638 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Tahquil says, &quot;If you beleive your org has stagnated because of your assigned God not being about, call 1-800-Ictinus.&quot;</span>
16:53:51.602788 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Pre-orders are typically handled via clans, which are usually player controlled.&quot;</span>
16:53:54.417230 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Proficy says in a guttural voice, &quot;But a few years back, was in need to be able to act in the interests of the city... and was... ignored to some degree... or shut out.&quot;</span>
16:54:12.057620 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;But ultimately yes, if you have a specific concern, then you can expect me to be responsive about it or at least tell you what to do to get it addressed.&quot;</span>
16:54:26.856980 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Veldrin says, &quot;How many questions are left in the queue?&quot;</span>
16:54:31.986014 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Two.&quot;</span>
16:54:33.758925 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;Aranos is next!&quot;</span>
16:54:35.383431 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;This is probably more hypothetical in nature, but is there an actual cap on the player base before you would feel the servers struggle to keep up? I know a lot of people have considered coming back and the amazing changes we have seen in such a short time, I think, speak to how the game has a potential to keep growing in the future. Quality of Life things really help new players adjust to the learning curve this style of game can bring.&quot;</span>
16:54:42.436881 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aegoth says something unintelligible.</span>

16:54:54.402370 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;The cap is several hundred.&quot;</span>
16:55:07.531399 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says, &quot;Cause I kill one Cyrenian sometimes and crash.&quot;</span>
16:55:08.192615 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Vix says to Tahquil in a soft, smoky voice, &quot;Assuming your org can get a God assigned.&quot;</span>

16:55:41.435277 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ereia says in a sotto, emphatic voice, &quot;Sometimes 5 dragon attacks come from the sky and the server stops to a halt too.&quot;</span>
16:55:46.085870 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Aranos says to Kasotus, &quot;No, I am catching everything they drop.&quot;</span>
16:56:05.036144 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Yilui says, &quot;Obviously the answer is to stop killing Cyrenians, duh.&quot;</span>
16:56:06.539639 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;I'll have to test. Time to kill more Cyrenians.&quot;</span>
16:56:11.017662 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Gallus says in a smoky, soft-spoken voice, &quot;I'll start with Laorir.&quot;</span>

I expect this is a long shot and likely a no, but I was curious if anything of this nature has been discussed.&quot;</span>

16:59:52.237802 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Laras says with a Shallamese accent, &quot;(I arrived a bit late, so if this topic has been addressed before, my apologies): My topic is TALISMANS. I sadly missed the initial start of the TALISMAN system due to dormancy. I have, for a longer while now, been experiencing a barrier of entry. A for me too steep learning curve to properly participate, and I have thus mostly admired it &quot;from afar&quot; - and I anecdotally feel I might not be the only one. I find it perfectly correct that talismans which have implications on a character's abilities should remain hard to collect for and complex to finalize. But I also came across (what i would like to call) &quot;flavour-talismans&quot; like those animals on Ageiro, where i sadly got lost after collecting 80ish pieces for some bird and eventually got stuck in the question what pieces are missing and eventually sadly gave up while trying to work the whole level-combining synthaxes (and a friend was already trying to help me). I have read the helpscrolls multiple times, and asked various people questions. I did manage to manifacture one or two simple Talismans, but that was sadly it. // That said, my suggestion: Since Talismans are such a wonderful and important layer in this game, I would like to suggest an -optional- TALISMAN INTROtour, maybe in two chapters (basic / advanced), along the lines of the newbie tour, but voluntarily and focussed on TALISMAN related training, only. There does not need to be any reward given (besides the knowledge one gathers in a more interactive and probably enjoyable way than helpscrolls can provide). Alternatively, it could be an elaborate TASK.&quot;</span>
17:00:32.268466 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;I think this one comes under a general improvement on accessibility and information availability.

17:01:51.766248 # <span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:aqua;">Ictinus, the Architect says, &quot;With the recent revamp of the combat system, how do you feel about it currently? I have a concern in that it doesn't appear to weight consistent winning or streaks very well. Example: I have fought 7 times, and I am ranked 5th. The 4 above me have fought 14, 24, 5, and 15 times. I am confused how myself and the person with only 5 wins can be higher ranked or even competitive with someone who has fought and won 3-4 times as many fights. I would like to suggest re-evaluating the system to ensure that win streaks and larger sample sizes are valued over smaller sample sizes much sooner. Alternatively keep a running median of number of fights and ensure that rankings reflect those who are higher than the median and lower than the median. As more fights take place, more fights are needed to break into the higher ranks.&quot;</span>

It would be great to have more options available in those currently existing too - tailoring patterns for example, like shorts! We have to be creative, and trousers-that-only-reach-the-knee really could just be shorts. If this is a possibility then it'll probably be good to open up this discussion on the expanded discord threads to see what people would like to see, as I'm sure we all have a lot of thoughts that go beyond this avenue of discussion.&quot;</span>
